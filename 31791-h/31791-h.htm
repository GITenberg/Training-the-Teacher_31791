<h3>CHARLES A. OLIVER</h3>

<h4>Teacher-Training Superintendent Pennsylvania<br />
State Sabbath School Association.</h4>


<p><b>Teacher-training Needed.</b>&mdash;No more serious problem faces
the Sunday-school to-day than the question of securing more
teachers and better teaching. We owe it to those who are called
to teach the Word to see that means of thorough preparation
be brought within their reach. The best teachers will welcome
a better training for Christ's service and many good people who
have not found their place in the work of the church will gladly
engage in Sunday-school teaching after they have been specially
instructed in the Bible and in the principles of teaching.</p>

<p>This book provides the essential elements for the teacher-training
course in four sections: (1) The Bible material which is the basis for
all Sunday-school instruction, under the title of "The Book," by Dr.
Schauffler. (2) A study of the working of the mind at various ages and
under differing conditions (a brief study of psychology), under the
title of "The Pupil," by Mrs. Lamoreaux. (3) A study of teaching
principles and the application of these principles (a brief study of
pedagogy), under the title of "The Teacher," by Dr. Brumbaugh. (4) A
study of the place in which this instruction should be given, that is,
"The School," by Mr. Lawrance. Additional material for instruction
will be found in the chapter "How the Bible came to Us" by Professor
Ira Maurice Price, and "The Gist of the Books."</p>

<p><b>Starting a Class.</b>&mdash;(1) No better beginning can be made than a
prayerful conference between the pastor and the Sunday-school
superintendent to determine the need and possibilities of
teacher-training within the local school. (2) The nearest
representative of organized Sunday-school work in your county or State
will gladly furnish you with printed matter pointing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> out the
teacher-training plans in successful use in your denomination. (3)
Select your text-book and familiarize yourself with it. (4) Call the
teachers and officers together. Have a half-hour social feature, to be
followed with an earnest address on the need and the plan of
teacher-training. Teach a sample lesson from the text-book. Endeavor
in that meeting to secure at least a few persons who will agree to
enter a class and will promise to do personal work to secure other
members. But do not make the mistake of requiring a large class before
beginning. A leader and two or more students will constitute a class.</p>

<p><b>Who Should Enter the Class?</b>&mdash;Two general plans are now in
operation. One provides for a training class for <i>present teachers</i>.
This class should meet at a convenient time during the week to
follow the course in a teacher-training text-book. A whole
evening could profitably be given to class work. If this is not
feasible the class may meet for study at the time of the weekly
teachers'-meeting or before or after the mid-week prayer service.</p>

<p>A second plan provides for the training of <i>prospective teachers</i>,
and this may be done in a class meeting at the time of the regular
school session. These should be found in the senior and adult
departments of the school and should be sixteen years of age or
older. The most promising young people in the school should
be sought for membership in this class. If possible, a separate
room should be provided so that the time of the closing exercises
of the school could be added to the lesson period of the class.
This will enable the class to devote ten minutes to a brief study
of the spiritual teachings of the general Bible lesson for the day
and yet leave a half-hour or more for the training lesson.</p>

<p>It should not be overlooked that if a class for present teachers
is established, the officers of the school will find the course
invaluable and parents will secure very helpful instruction in
the care and nurture of young children.</p>

<p><b>Making the Class a Success.</b>&mdash;It is possible for one student to
follow a teacher-training course alone, but it is very desirable
for two or more to join and take the course in class. Several
persons meeting for conference will bring better results than the
same persons studying individually. The class should have a
leader who is a sympathetic, patient, tactful Christian man or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
woman, who will inspire the members to continue in their work,
and who will see that every session of the class is a conference
and not a lecture. Indifferent work should be discouraged.
The members of the class are more likely to continue to the end
of the course if they have the consciousness of mastering the
work. The question and answer method should be emphasized,
and the entire period of the class should be given at frequent
intervals to reviews. Illuminating essays and talks may be
brought into the class, but these should be brief, and should deal
in a simple way with side-lights on the lesson assigned for that
period.</p>

<p>It is very desirable that the class should be enrolled with the
denominational teacher-training department and with the State
Sunday School Association. This enrolment will furnish the
officers of these organizations with information which will enable
them to keep in touch with the class and to send from time to
time helpful and inspirational suggestions. The enrolment of
the class will also cause the members to feel the importance of
the course and will strengthen the sense of obligation to do
thorough work.</p>

<p>The official examinations are of the greatest importance, and
should be taken by every member of the class. These examination
tests intensify interest, and help to hold the class together
until the end of the course.</p>

<p>Great encouragement will be given to the members of the class
if public recognition is made of their work from time to time.
Brief words spoken in public commending the work which is
being done will often tide some faltering member over the crisis
of hesitation. The denominational Sunday-school leaders and
officers of organized Sunday-school work frequently may be
called upon to lend encouragement by their helpful presence at
some public function of the class.</p>

<p>The diploma issued by the denominations or by the International Sunday
School Association is a fitting recognition of work done, and gives
the student a place in the enlarging fellowship of trained teachers.
Alumni Associations are being formed in the States with annual
reunions. Graduating exercises should be provided, and these should be
impressive and dignified services<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> that will show to the church and
community the emphasis the Sunday-school is placing on high grade
work.</p>

<p>The Sunday School Times Company does not offer any certificates or
diplomas, nor does it conduct any teacher-training classes. All this
is carried on by the denominations, or through the agency of the State
Sunday School Associations.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Bible" id="The_Bible"></a>The Bible</h2>


<p><b>1. Methods of Bible Study.</b>&mdash;Microscopic study of the Bible
is the study of smaller portions, such as single verses, or parts
of chapters. Many sermons adopt this method. It is good for
many purposes.  But it fails to give the larger views of Bible
history that the teacher needs for effective work. The telescopic
method takes in large sections of the Word, and considers them
in their relation to the whole of revelation. This is the method
that will be adopted in these studies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 70%;">
<img src="images/illus-011.png" width="100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><b>2. To assist in the study</b> of a general survey of Bible history,
we give as a memory outline above a chart of the centuries
between Adam and Christ. We use in this the chronology in our
Bibles, not because it is correct, but because scholars have not
yet agreed on a better, especially for the ages before Abraham.</p>

<p>All the names are well-known but that of Jared, and his is put
in merely to mark the close of the first half-millennium. Memorize
these names so that you can reproduce the chart without looking
at the book. This exercise of memory will enable you to locate
the chief events of Bible history roughly in their appropriate
chronological environment. Are you reading about any event
in the wanderings of Israel? Of course you are between the
letters M. and S. Is it a story of Elijah that you are studying?
Then the event must lie between the letters S. and Z. Or is it
the biography of Nehemiah that forms your lesson? Then it
must lie to the right of the letter Z.</p>

<p><b>3. One peculiarity of the Bible narrative</b> is that at times
it is quite diffuse, and covers much space on the sacred page,
while at other times it is most highly condensed. For example,
the first twelve chapters of Genesis cover over 2000 years at
the lowest computation. All the rest of Genesis (thirty-eight
chapters) covers the lives of four men, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,
and Joseph. The first chapter of Exodus covers centuries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
while all the rest of Exodus, all of Leviticus, all of Numbers and
all of Deuteronomy cover only forty years. Surely there must
be some good reason for this. Again, two chapters in Matthew
and two in Luke cover thirty years of our Lord's life, while all
the rest of the four Gospels cover only three and a half years.</p>

<p><b>4. Another peculiarity</b> of the Word is that the miraculous
element is very unevenly distributed. At times miracles abound,
and at other times they are but few in number. In the first
eleven chapters of Genesis, covering more than 2000 years, there
are few miracles, outside of those of the creation. But in the
period after that, covered by the four great Patriarchs, we find
more miracles than before.</p>

<p>During the Mosaic period, beginning with Exodus 2, we find that
miracles begin to multiply as never before. For instance, God fed his
people for forty years (except on the Sabbath) with manna. Again, in
the times of Elijah and Elisha, the narrative amplifies, and the
miracles multiply. And once more when we come to the Messianic period,
as exemplified in the story of Christ, the narrative becomes fourfold,
and the miracles multiply as never before. What is the reason for this
amplification of narrative and simultaneous multiplication of the
miraculous? It is because these periods were exceptionally
significant. In them God was trying to teach men lessons of peculiar
importance. So he led the writers to tell the story more in full, and
he himself emphasized the teaching by his own Divine interposition.</p>

<p><b>5. In the Patriarchal period God</b> was calling out him who
was to be the founder of that people which was to preserve God's
law through the ages, and from whom at last was to come Jesus,
the Redeemer of the world. This was a most important period,
and one with which we might well become acquainted.</p>

<p><b>6. In the Mosaic period</b> God was bringing out his people
from bondage and was giving to them laws that were to shape
their national life for all time. He was also giving to them a
typology in high priest, tabernacle, and sacrifice that was to lead
them in the way of truth until, in the fulness of the time, he was to
come who was the fulfilment of both law and type, Jesus of
Nazareth, the Lamb of God, and the Son of God.</p>

<p><b>7. In the period of Elijah</b> and his great pupil, Elisha,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
God was making a great effort to call back to himself Israel, or
the Northern Kingdom, which had been led into gross idolatry
by Jeroboam, and later by Ahab.</p>

<p><b>8. In the Messianic period</b> God was fulfilling all that he
had promised from the beginning as to a Redeemer who was to
come. He who had spoken to the fathers through the prophets,
and the various types, was now to speak to men through the
person of his Son. Good reason then why, at the four periods
to which we have called attention, God should provide that the
narrative should be more full than at other times, and that
simultaneously there should be the marked intervention of the
miraculous, to prove that God was truly speaking to men, and
giving them divine directions as to how to act, and what to believe.</p>

<p><b>9. It follows, then,</b> that there are four periods to which we
should pay especial attention, as being of unusual importance,
and these are the Patriarchal period, the Mosaic period, the
period of Elijah and Elisha, and the period of the Messiah. If
the student be well posted as to the occurrences during these
periods, and their teaching, he will have at least a good working
outline of the whole of the Bible history in its most important
developments. To emphasize these periods we have added on
the chart in the Memory Outline the dots that will be seen,
multiplying them at each period somewhat in proportion to the
multiplication of the miraculous element in the narrative.</p>

<b>SIGNIFICANCE OF EVENTS.</b>&mdash;The Old Testament begins with a statement of
the creation; tells of the introduction of man, "made in the image of
God;" records the downfall of man and God's many efforts to redeem
him; recites the incidents of God's dealings with chosen individuals,
selected families and a particular nation; continues with this nation
separated into two parts and held captive by a foreign power, and
closes with the return of a part of Judah. With the entrance of sin
came the promise of salvation through one who should come out of the
chosen (Jewish) nation.</p>


<h4>The Old Testament Preview</h4>

<h5>
<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The Chronology used throughout is based on<br />
"The Dated Events of the Old Testament,"<br />
by Willis Judson Beecher.</h5>

<p><b>1. Two Great Divisions.</b>&mdash;In biblical history here are two
great divisions, that of the Old Testament and that of the New
Testament. It is well to have clear outlines in our minds with
regard to the great outstanding characteristics of these periods.
In making these divisions into the periods that follow we have no
"Thus saith the Lord" for our guidance, but use the best common
sense that we have. Others might make a different division,
but we give that below as at the least suggestive.</p>

<p><b>2. Prelude.</b>&mdash;The great prelude of creation.  Here we are
told that all things find their origin in God. This teaching is
in contradistinction to the claim that matter is eternal. It also
denies the doctrine that the world was made by chance.  It
places the beginning of all things seen in the power of One who
is from eternity to eternity. This satisfies the cravings of the
human heart as no other teaching does.</p>

<p><b>3. First Period.&mdash;Adam to Noah.</b> Here we have the first
stage in the drama of human history. In it we find the beginnings
of the human race, of sin, and of redemption. Three most
important beginnings. It is covered by Genesis 2 to 5 inclusive.
It is marked by total failure on the part of man. "Every imagination
of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually"
(Gen. 6:5). Man proved himself recreant to God's holy law.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p><b>4. Second Period.&mdash;Noah to Abraham.</b> Chapters 6 to 12.
God makes a new beginning with the family of Noah. But,
as before, man proves himself disobedient and faithless to his
God. We find a great civilization, but little godliness. For
the second time man proves a failure, so far as obedience to God's
law is concerned. Man in his pride says, "Come, let us build,"
while God on his part says, "Come, let us confound" (Gen. 11:4
and 7).</p>

<p>But little space is given in the Bible to these two periods, for
they are in reality preliminary to the third, which is of vastly
more importance than the two put together.</p>

<p><b>5. Third Period.&mdash;Abraham to Kings.</b> Genesis 12 through
to 1 Samuel 9. This is a most important period. Here God
changes his method of treating man. From henceforth he will
chiefly communicate truth to mankind through a chosen family
and nation. Not that no man outside of this circle can know
God's will, but that especially through Abraham and his seed
God chooses to make his will known, until, in the fulness of time,
Jesus, the son of Abraham according to the flesh, shall come and
reveal clearly God's love and redemption to men.</p>

<p>In this section we have the story of the patriarchal family,
first coming out of Ur of the Chaldees, and living for a while in
Canaan. Then they go down to Egypt, and at last are oppressed.
After being welded together in the furnace of affliction they
are brought out with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and
in the wilderness they receive the law of God through their great
leader, Moses. Here too they learn the way of acceptable
worship, and are prepared for entry into the Land of Promise.
Then follows the conquest of the land under Moses' successor,
Joshua. Now comes the period of the Judges, when God rules
his people directly through these divinely called men. This
is easily seen to be a most important period. All this time
Israel only is monotheistic (believing in one God), but all the
other nations of the earth are grossly idolatrous. During this
period we see that so long as God's chosen people obey him
they prosper, while as soon as they disobey disasters begin to
multiply.</p>

<p>In this period, too, was given that legislation which has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the foundation of all the legislation of civilized nations from
that time to this. Here also we have the foundations of that
system of types that culminated in Jesus, great David's greater
Son. Sacrifice, high priest, tabernacle, here have their origin
or their development. In all the history of the world up to that
time there was no period so fraught with blessings for mankind
as was this period.</p>

<p><b>6. Fourth Period.&mdash;Kings to captivity.</b>  1 Samuel 9 to
2 Kings 25. This may be divided into two parts:</p>

<p>(1) The united monarchy. This lasted one hundred and
twenty years, and had three kings, Saul, David, Solomon. Saul
brought something of order out of national chaos. David
carried this still farther and made Israel truly a great nation.
Solomon, however, through too much luxury and many political
alliances, sowed the seeds of national decay.</p>

<p>(2) Now comes the division of the monarchy, brought on by
the folly of Rehoboam, Solomon's son. Because of his refusal
to lighten the heavy taxes, ten tribes revolted and established
a kingdom under Jeroboam. Ever after this they were known
as Israel, also called by us the Northern Kingdom. The Kingdom
of Judah is also known as the Southern Kingdom.</p>

<p>Israel, or the <i>Northern Kingdom</i> went from the worship of the golden
calves to that of Baal, and continued on the downward course until
they went into captivity. They had only one good king, named Jehu, and
he was none too good.</p>

<p>Judah, or the <i>Southern Kingdom</i> fared somewhat better, though
even here there was much idolatry. At last Judah too went into
captivity, on account of its sin. It is most suggestive to compare
the triumphant entry of Israel into the land, and its shameful
exit in chains and tears. It was all brought about through
abandoning the God of Abraham. There are some in modern
days who claim that Israel had naturally a monotheistic
tendency, and on that account slowly worked its way out of polytheism
into monotheism. The writer does not so read the history,
but finds that Israel had an inveterate tendency to polytheism,
and that God only cured it of this sin through the sorrows
of the captivity.</p>

<p><b>7. Fifth Period.&mdash;Captivity and return.</b> Read Ezra and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Nehemiah. This is not a period of great glory, like that of
Solomon's reign. But it is a period most remarkable on account
of the fact that Judah was now strictly monotheistic, and from
that day to this, over two thousand years, it has remained so.
In the furnace fires of captivity God cured his people once and
forever of their besetting sin, idolatry. This is a most remarkable
fact, for the nations into which they went as captives were
themselves totally idolatrous.</p>

<p>In this period comes the building of the second temple, the
reform under Ezra, and the building of the walls of Jerusalem,
under Nehemiah.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> Now the story closes for four centuries and does not open
until the New Testament times (with which we shall deal later
on) begin.</p>

</div>

<p><b>PRINCIPAL EVENTS</b></p>

<p><b>Prelude.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Account of the Creation.</b>&mdash;The creation days: Light (Gen. 1:3-5);
firmament (1:6-8); land and water separated, vegetation (1:9-13);
heavenly bodies&mdash;sun, moon, stars (1:14-19); fish, birds and animals
(1:19-25); man (1:26-31).</p></div>

<p><b>First Period.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Creation of Man.</b>&mdash;Man made in God's image (Gen. 1:27); creation of Eve
(Gen. 2:21, 22). Entrance of sin and the fall (3:1-6); Cain, son of
Adam and Eve, killed his brother Abel (4:3-8).</p></div>

<p><b>Second Period.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>The Flood.</b>&mdash;The prevalence of wickedness (Gen. 6:5) caused God to
destroy the population of the world by flood, with the exception of
Noah, his family, and selected animals (Gen. 6-8). God made a covenant
with Noah not to destroy the people again by flood (9:8-17)</p>

<p><b>The Tower of Babel.</b>&mdash;The wickedness in the heart of men found
expression in the building of the great tower of Babel, and the
punishment therefor was the confusion of tongues (11:1-9).</p></div>

<p><b>TIME.</b>&mdash;From an unknown time to 1928 B. C.</p>

<p><b>PLACES.</b>&mdash;Garden of Eden, Western Asia, Babylon.</p>

<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE OF EVENTS.</b>&mdash;The creative period marks
God as the supreme author of the universe and of its inhabi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>tants;
sinless at first, man falls, and begins the battle with
evil which shall cease only with the ultimate complete
triumph of Christ, the Redeemer. The flood marks the first
of a series of tremendous efforts to save the world from the
thraldom of sin.</p>


<h4>Before the Chosen Family</h4>

<p><b>9. Prelude.</b>&mdash;This is the beginning of all things, and well
suits the cravings of the human mind. It says, "In the beginning
God created." This beginning does not go as far back as
that of John 1:1, for that antedates creation and points to a
beginning before God created. That is, John sweeps back to
that beginning when as yet there was none but God. If this
statement of Genesis 1:1 is compared with creation myths
as found among other nations, it will at once be seen to be far
grander and more in accord with our best thoughts of the divine
activity. Unbelief may say, "In the beginning matter," or "in
the beginning force," but that does not satisfy the human heart
as do the words of the sacred writer.</p>

<p><b>In this beginning</b> we see the origin of all things. Genesis
means "beginnings," and in this book we find the beginnings
of matter, of vegetable life, of animal life, of man, of sin,
of sacrifice, of material civilization, of the Covenant People, and
of Redemption. Truly a wonderful book. Well has it been said
that "<i>Genesis enfolds all that the rest of the Bible unfolds.</i>" In this
book we find the germ of all that is to follow. If we would know
the inner significance of all that we find in Genesis we must look
to Revelation.</p>

<p><b>10. Period One.&mdash;Adam to Noah.</b> Here comes the story of
the creation of man. Innocent he was at the first, but in the
trial to which he is brought, man fails, and disobeys. As sinner,
he now hides from the face of God, and has to be sought out by
his heavenly Father. Sin created a barrier between God the
Holy One and man the sinner. Then it is that God begins his
work of redemption, and in Genesis 3:15 we see the first
promise of that redemption that is to be fulfilled in Jesus in later
days. In this period we see the first sacrifice, and in it, too, we
come across the full fruitage of hatred, which culminated in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
murder. Man proves to be a sad failure, and the record is that
God looks down from heaven to see how man is acting. "And
Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only
evil continually" (Gen. 6:5). From that day to this, man
when left to himself reproduces this picture, as may be seen in
those lands where there is no light of the gospel of the grace of
God.</p>

<p><b>The chief characters</b> of this period are Adam and Eve,
Cain and Abel, Enoch, who "walked with God: and he was
not; for God took him," Noah and his three sons&mdash;Shem,
Ham, and Japheth.</p>

<p><b>11. Period Two.</b>&mdash;This lasts from <b>Noah to Abraham</b>. God
blots out the human race as it then existed and begins it anew.
So far, all that we know of the human race lived in the Euphrates
valley, and all modern research confirms the Bible statement with
regard to this. It need not be maintained that the flood was
universal, in the sense that it covered the whole world, as we
now know it. All that is needful to believe is that the "known
world" was subject to a devastating flood that caused the human
race to perish, with the exception of Noah and his family.
Warned by God Noah builds the ark, and embarks in it. The
rains descend and the fountains of the great deep are broken
up, and the land is submerged. In due time, the rains cease,
and the floods dry up, and Noah sends out first a raven, which
returns not. Then he sends out a dove, which comes back to
the ark, not finding any resting-place. In seven days he sends
out another dove, which returns bringing an olive-leaf in her
mouth. The third time he sends forth a dove, which returns
not. Then in due time Noah goes forth from the ark, which
had rested on Mount Ararat in Armenia.</p>

<p><b>12.</b> Now follows the beautiful story of the sacrifice that Noah
offers, and the promise of God never again to send a deluge on
the earth. This promise is confirmed by the symbol of the rainbow.
Of course there had been rainbows before this, but this
time God takes the rainbow and makes it a symbol of his mercy
to sinful man.</p>

<p><b>13. The Tower of Babel.</b>&mdash;In this period we there is a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
advance in civilization, as may be seen by a careful reading
of Genesis 10:1-32. Cities are built and nations are founded
by the descendants of the Patriarch Noah. But the evil tendency
of the human heart again shows itself, and the pride of man's
achievement fills the heart of the descendants of Noah. Then
comes the story of the tower of Babel, and in this we read most
significantly, "And they said, Come, let us build." To this
God's reply is "Come, let us confound." Man's pride is to be
abased, and put to confusion. So the human race is scattered
abroad and its cherished plans are broken up. For the second
time, man is seen to be a failure, and there is call for another
way of dealing with the race if the truth is to be preserved. This
third beginning is to be found in Period Three, with which our
next lesson will deal.</p>

<h3>Lesson 3</h3>

<h2>From Abraham to Jacob</h2>

<h5>Old Testament Division&mdash;Third Period</h5>


<div class="figright" style="width: 40%;">
<img src="images/illus-023.png" width="100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><b>LEADING PERSONS</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Abraham.</b>&mdash;Lived in Ur of the Chaldees. Called by God to
leave country and home and kindred to go to Canaan, the
promised land (Gen. 12:1 to 25:11).</p>

<p><b>Isaac.</b>&mdash;Son of Abraham (Gen. 21). Proposed as a sacrifice
(Gen. 22:1-19). Married Rebekah (Gen. 24).</p>

<p><b>Esau.</b>&mdash;Son of Isaac. Sold his birthright to his brother
(Gen. 25:27-34).</p>

<p><b>Jacob.</b>&mdash;Son of Isaac. By a trick secured his father's parting
blessing, to which Esau was entitled (Gen. 27:1-45). Journeyed in
search of a wife, and married (Gen. 28:10 to 31:16). Returned and was
forgiven by Esau (Gen. 31:17 to 33:20). His name changed to Israel and
he became the father of the Jewish nation (Gen. 35:9-15). Had twelve
sons, who become the heads of the Twelve Tribes of Israel (Gen.
35:23-27).</p></div>

<p><b>TIME.</b>&mdash;1928 B. C. to the birth of Joseph, 1752 B. C.</p>

<p><b>PLACES.</b>&mdash;Ur of Chaldees, Canaan, Egypt.</p>

<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE OF EVENTS.</b>&mdash;With Abraham God began a course of
dealings with man which continued for about two thousand years.
Setting apart Abraham with his family was really the beginning of the
chosen nation, although the national life did not begin until after
the escape from Egypt (see <a href="#Page_33">Lesson 5</a>).</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<h4>Abraham, the Father of the Faithful</h4>

<p><b>14. The Bible Deals Largely in Biographies.</b>&mdash;If you know
well the stories of the great Patriarchs, you know the best part of
Genesis. Again, if you know the stories of Moses, Joshua,
Gideon, Samuel, David, you will have mastered most of the history
of Israel from Exodus through 2 Samuel. This is the reason why
in these lessons we deal so largely with Bible biographies.</p>

<p><b>15. Abraham.</b>&mdash;Abraham was one of the greatest men in all
history. He was the founder of that people through whom we
have received all of the Bible, excepting only what Luke, the
beloved Physician, has given us. This of itself is no small
distinction. But more. He is the great progenitor of him whom
we know as the Messiah and the world's Redeemer.</p>

<p><b>16. Abraham and his Call.</b>&mdash;The call came to him in his
home in Ur of the Chaldees. Exactly in what way it came we are
not told. It may have been an inward call, such as believers to
this day have at times. Bear in mind that Abraham's ancestors
were idolaters, and that the land in which he lived was totally
idolatrous.</p>

<p>This call was twofold. It was a call "out of," and a call
"in to." Out of home and family and religious antecedent.
In to a new environment geographically, socially, religiously.</p>

<p>This call he obeyed at once, and forth he went, not knowing
his ultimate destination. At Haran he paused until the death
of his father. Then on he went. How he knew what direction
to take we are not told. It may have been that he pushed forward
as the migrating bird pushes ahead, driven by a kind of
inward impulse, blindly but surely. This at least is my idea.</p>

<p><b>17. Abraham and the Land.</b>&mdash;At last Abraham comes to
Shechem, and there for the first time God tells him that this is
the land of which he had spoken. There, for the first time in
that land, an altar was raised to the true God. From that day
to this, and to the end of time, that land and the Chosen People
have been and will be identified.</p>

<p><b>18. Abraham and Egypt.</b>&mdash;Driven by famine, the Patriarch
goes down to Egypt. There is no record that he was divinely
guided in this, and from the fact that there he gets into trouble,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and that God does not appear to him at all in Egypt, we may
infer that this was not any part of the divine plan. God does
not appear to his servant again until he returns to the Land,
and builds his altar "where it was at the first" (Gen. 13:1-18).</p>

<p><b>19. Abraham and Lot.</b>&mdash;Lot was Abraham's nephew. His character
differs widely from that of his uncle. Mark, in his dealings with his
greedy nephew, the grandeur of the Patriarch's character. As the land
cannot "bear" the two sets of flocks, Abraham gives Lot the first
choice of the land, and declares that he will take what Lot leaves.
This is not after the manner of the "natural man." Decency would have
led Lot to decline his uncle's generous offer. But Lot was not decent,
and so seized all that he could. In the end this led to Lot's ruin. It
is most suggestive to note the steps in Lot's career. First he pitched
his tent "towards" Sodom. Then we find him "in" Sodom. Then he sits in
"the gate" of Sodom&mdash;that is, he has become a prominent man in that
accursed city. Soon we see him involved in the overthrow of Sodom by
the four kings. Still he returns to that city, after his rescue by his
uncle. And at last he has to escape from its final ruin, penniless. We
read in 2 Peter 2:7 that Lot was vexed with the wicked life of the
Sodomites. It has always seemed a pity that he was not sufficiently
vexed to get out from the city, bag and baggage, long before he did.</p>

<p>Again look at Abraham when he had gained the victory over
the kings as told in Genesis 14. How grandly he stands, refusing
to touch what comes from Sodom from a thread to a shoe latchet.
By the laws of war in that time all the "loot" was his. But he
would not touch it. Bear in mind that this was 2000 years
before the Golden Rule was given, yet here we have a man
exemplifying it grandly. What a contrast between Abraham
and some of the troops in modern sieges, where they have seized
all that they could lay their hands on. This was nearly 2000 years
after Jesus uttered the Golden Rule. Who was more truly
Christ-like, Abraham 2000 years B. C. or we, 2000 years A. D.?</p>

<p><b>20. Abraham and Hagar.</b>&mdash;The Patriarch was not a perfect man. He sinned
in Egypt (Gen. 12:10-20), and again, as told in Genesis 20:1-16.
Again, his faith in God's promise that he should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> have a son seems to
have grown dim. So he yields to Sarah's suggestion, and takes Hagar.
(Gen. 16). In judging him for this, bear in mind that he had not the
light that came in later days, through the further revelation of God's
will. Then Ishmael was born. It is most suggestive that from Ishmael,
who was not a "child of faith," sprang in later days Muhammad the
great antagonist of Jesus Christ, who came from Abraham through Isaac,
the "child of faith."</p>

<p><b>21. Abraham and Isaac.</b>&mdash;To understand the command of
God in relation to the sacrifice of Isaac, we must bear in mind
the customs of those days in Canaan. As we now know, through
excavations in that land, human sacrifices were common.
Remembering this, my own impression is that God intended to
teach his servant two things by this command. First, that all
human sacrifices were abhorrent to God; and second, that his
obedience must be unquestioning. God never intended that
Isaac should be sacrificed. This is apparent from the whole
narrative. His command was a "test" of the utter obedience
of the Patriarch. This test Abraham met grandly. He was
willing to trust God to the last, though he could not see the
reason why. Then God showed him that his son was not to be
sacrificed, and provided in Isaac's place a ram for an offering.</p>

<p>The story of procuring a wife for Isaac is truly oriental in its
setting. But bear in mind, it was accompanied with prayer.
Though it is not in accord with Western methods of courtship,
it turned out quite as well as many modern marriages made after
the custom of twentieth century "society."</p>

<p><b>22. Abraham and Sodom.</b>&mdash;Here again we have this man
in a grand light. He pleads for Sodom, and that, in spite of
its utter worthlessness. But there are not in all of Sodom
twenty righteous men to be found. Lot's family even, merely
scoff at him, and refuse to believe his warning. It is most
suggestive in this connection, that "God remembered Abraham,
and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow." (Gen. 19:29.)
Lot's best asset in his life was not his real estate in Sodom,
but his godly uncle far from that wicked city. Just so the best
asset that any modern city has, is not its stocks and bonds, or
real estate, but the truly godly people who live in its midst.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p><b>23. Abraham and Machpelah.</b>&mdash;There are two places in
Canaan most intimately associated with Abraham. These are
Shechem, where he first learned that he was in "the Land"
at last, and Machpelah, where he laid Sarah to rest and where
he himself was buried. Here also were buried Isaac, Jacob,
Rebekah, and Leah. (See Gen. 25:9, 49:30, and 50:13.) It
would not be very surprising if some day we were to recover
their bodies from that historic burying-place. Stranger things
have happened.</p>

<h3>Lesson 4</h3>

<h2>Joseph</h2>

<h5>Old Testament Division&mdash;Third Period (Continued)</h5>


<div class="figright" style="width: 40%;">
<img src="images/illus-028.png" width="100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><b>LEADING PERSON</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Joseph.</b>&mdash;Son of Jacob. A favorite son (Gen. 37:3) and a dreamer (Gen.
37:5-11). Hated by his brothers and sold into Egypt (Gen. 37:12-28). A
slave, but honored; then cast into prison (Gen. 39:1-20). By
interpreting a dream of Pharaoh he was brought into high honor, and
became Pharaoh's prime minister (Gen. 40:1 to 41:45). Stored up grain
in Egypt to provide for a famine; relieved the needs of his brothers,
who journeyed to Egypt in search of food; finally invited his father's
family to live in Egypt (Gen. 42:1 to 47:12).</p>

<p><b>Other Persons.</b>&mdash;Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of
Pharaoh, owner of Joseph the slave. The butler and the baker of
Pharaoh, confined in prison while Joseph was there, and the indirect
means of Joseph's exaltation. Jacob, Joseph's father; and Joseph's
brothers who sold him into Egypt.</p></div>

<p><b>TIME.</b>&mdash;1752 B. C. to 1643 B. C.</p>

<p><b>PLACES.</b>&mdash;Dothan, in Palestine. Egypt.</p>

<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE OF EVENTS.</b>&mdash;As a result of Joseph's invitation to
his father and brothers, with their family, to come to Egypt and
partake of his bounty, the Hebrew nation, through its leader, was
transplanted to Egypt. Their sojourn as a people lasted many years;
and brought them into subjection to the Egyptian monarch (Exod.
1:8-14).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<h4>Joseph&mdash;Prisoner and Prime Minister</h4>

<p>Here we have a wonderful character. The life of Joseph may
be divided into two parts. First, his humiliation. Second, his
exaltation.</p>

<p><b>24. Joseph's Humiliation.</b>&mdash;Genesis 37, 39, and 40. We see him first as
his father's favorite, unwisely made conspicuous by the dress that his
doting father gave him. This arouses his brothers' envy. This envy was
further intensified when Joseph told them the dreams that he had,
which plainly foretold his exaltation, but which made them angry. Even
his father seems to have balked at the second dream (Gen. 37:10). Now
comes the cruel plot of the heartless brothers, planned at Dothan,
though, through the providence of God, not fully carried out. Their
definite purpose is to put him out of the way, "and we shall see what
will become of his dreams."</p>

<p>25. Here then we have a clear statement of God's plans and
men's plans with regard to this seventeen-year-old lad. God
proposes to make him mighty in deeds for the welfare of God's
people. Men propose to put him to death. These two plans
cannot both be carried into effect. Which is to prevail? The
story is a fascinating unrolling of the divine plan and the complete
thwarting of the human plan.</p>

<p><b>26. Joseph the Slave.</b>&mdash;The brothers change their plan, and sell Joseph
to traveling Midianites. These take him to Egypt, and sell him to
Potiphar, an officer in Pharaoh's court. Note here his fidelity in all
things, so that he becomes really the overseer in Potiphar's house
(Gen. 39:6). Instead of resenting his purchase by Potiphar, he takes
things most patiently, and does his duty bravely.</p>

<p><b>27. Joseph in Prison.</b>&mdash;Once more, through no fault of his
own, Joseph suffers further degradation. To prison he goes.
We said "through no fault of his own." This is an understatement,
for it was on account of his fidelity to his master that he
was shamefully traduced, and so sent to jail. Yet even here his
spirit of loyalty to duty did not desert him. Again we find him
trusted and put in charge of all prison matters. (Gen. 39:22,
23.) But what has become all this time of God's plans for Joseph?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Are they to be thwarted? Nay, wait until the fulness of time,
and then note how God's plans ripen, and are fully perfected.
In the meantime note Joseph's wonderfully sweet spirit. See how
he notices the sad countenances of butler and baker in prison.
Note how he sympathizes with them, and tries to help them.
Here again, as in the case of Abraham, we see the exemplification
of the Golden Rule, long before it was uttered. Had Joseph
been like some modern men, he would have taken vengeance on
the butler and baker, they being Egyptians. He would have
said, "These Egyptians have enslaved and imprisoned me for
no fault of mine. Now is my chance, and I will pay them back."
But no such bitter thoughts seem to have entered his pure mind.
In the meantime note his steadfast faith in God and his persistent
loyalty to duty, however hard that might be.</p>

<p><b>28. Joseph's Exaltation.</b>&mdash;This came with a leap. The story
is familiar. But in studying the lesson, let the student not fail to
read it once more, most carefully. If it seem somewhat incredible
that Pharaoh should make a prime minister out of a prisoner
at one stroke, bear in mind that in the East they do not do things
in Western fashion. Even to this day</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"East is East, and West is West,<br />
And never the two shall meet."<br />
</p></div>

<p>The writer during his boyhood knew of a case illustrating Eastern
methods, which took place when he was living in his home in
Constantinople. The Sultan had a dentist. One day while his dentist
was off hunting, the Sultan got a toothache. He sent for his dentist,
but could not get him. His courtiers then got hold of a poor dentist
who could hardly make his living. He went to the palace and extracted
the offending molar. At once the Sultan deposed his regular dentist,
put this man in his place, created him a pasha, or peer of the realm,
gave him a large stipend, and a palace in the city and another in the
country. Thus at one stroke the man passed from obscurity to
prominence, and from poverty to wealth. This is the manner of the
East.</p>

<p>Now we begin to see God's plans working out manifestly. Yet
all this time his brothers think that their plans have succeeded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
and that the "dreamer's" career is ended. No, the "dreamer's"
career has just begun.</p>

<p><b>29. The Seven Years of Plenty.</b>&mdash;Now follow years of great
activity, and of much honor for the former prisoner. Up and
down the land he goes and gathers grain in untold quantities.
As he goes they all cry, "Bow the knee," and prostrate themselves
in the dust before him. At seventeen years of age he was
sold by his brothers. For thirteen years he was slave, or prisoner.
Now for seven years he is prime minister. Yet all the time Jacob
thinks that his boy is dead. How little did the old Patriarch
suspect that during all these weary years God was working out
his blessed plans for his people.</p>

<p><b>30. The Seven Years of Famine.</b>&mdash;Once more Joseph and his
brothers stand face to face. The last they saw of him was when
they heard his bitter cry, and turned a deaf ear to his entreaty.
Twenty years have made a great change in him and they do not
recognize him. His treatment of them may seem harsh, but he
knew what kind of natures theirs were, and that to do them good
he must first humiliate them. Out of kindness he was stern.
To mend them and their ways he must first break them.</p>

<p><b>31. Israel in Egypt.</b>&mdash;God had told Abraham that his seed must go down
to Egypt, and now comes the fulfilment of that prophecy (Gen.
15:13-15). During the life of Joseph all went well with the sons of
Jacob. They had the best of the land, and dwelt in peace. God's plans
have been carried out to the minutest details, and the plans of
evil-minded men have miscarried. God has caused even the wrath of man
to praise him, and the remainder he has restrained. Joseph's brethren
are content to bow before him, and even Jacob sees that his words of
Genesis 37:10 were not wise. The wisdom of man is seen to be folly,
and it has been proved that "the foolishness of God is wiser than
men." (1 Cor. 1:25.)</p>

<p><b>32. Joseph's Faith.</b>&mdash;On his death-bed Joseph takes an oath
of his people saying that God will surely visit his people and bring
them in due time to the land promised to Abraham. He charges
them to remember his body when they march out, and take it
with them, and lay it away in its final resting-place in the Land of
Promise. Many years pass. Liberty is exchanged for oppression.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
The bitter cry of the people rises to God. All this time the body
of Joseph (doubtless embalmed) is not finally buried. His real
funeral has not yet taken place. This is the longest delayed
funeral on record. Then at last comes the Exodus, and lo, they
remember that oath that Joseph took of them, years before,
and out with them goes his body. For forty years they carry it
with them, and only then they lay it away in the Land of Promise.
(See Gen. 50:24-26. Exod. 13:19, and Josh. 24:32.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 40%;">
<img src="images/illus-033.png" width="100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><b>LEADING PERSONS</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Moses.</b>&mdash;Son of Amram and Jochebed (Exod. 6:20). Adopted by Pharaoh's
daughter (Exod. 2:1-10). Took the part of the oppressed and had to
flee (Exod. 2:11-14). Shepherd for forty years and married (Exod.
2:21). Called to deliver his people, but was timid (Exod. 3:1-10). Had
various contests with Pharaoh (Exod. 5 to 12). Led people out of Egypt
triumphantly (Exod. 14). Received the Ten Commandments (Exod. 20).
Built the Tabernacle (Exod. 25). Led the people to the borders of the
Promised Land, but was turned back on account of their sins (Num. 13:1
to 14:34). Died on Mount Nebo (Deut. 34). Reappeared on Mount of
Transfiguration (Matt. 17:3).</p>

<p><b>Aaron.</b>&mdash;Brother of Moses. Made high priest (Exod. 28
and 29). Sinned in the matter of the golden calf (Exod.
32). Died on Mount Hor (Deut. 10:6).</p></div>

<p><b>TIME.</b>&mdash;1578 B. C. to 1458 B. C.</p>

<p><b>PLACES.</b>&mdash;Egypt and Sinaitic Peninsula, then east of the
Jordan valley.</p>

<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE OF EVENTS.</b>&mdash;The "going out" of the Hebrews from
Egypt marked the beginning of their national life, and laws were given
governing their relation to God and to each other. The breaking of
God's laws cost the nation forty years of wilderness wandering before
they entered their "promised land."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<h4>Moses&mdash;Leader and Legislator</h4>

<p><b>33.</b> By far the greatest man in Old Testament history is Moses.
In point of moral uplift, no man in all the world, until Christ,
can be compared with him. His life divides itself into three equal
sections&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) Life at Pharaoh's court.&mdash;Forty years.<br />
(2) Life as shepherd in the desert.&mdash;Forty years.<br />
(3) Life in the desert as leader of God's people.&mdash;Forty years.</p></div>

<p><b>34. Life at Pharaoh's court.</b>&mdash;Moses was born at the time of Israel's
greatest oppression, when, as a measure of self-defense, Pharaoh had
ordered all Hebrew male children to be cast into the Nile. Hence the
Hebrew proverb, "When the tale of bricks is doubled, then comes
Moses." As in the case of Joseph, we see at once the collision between
God's plan and that of earth's greatest monarch. God's plan was that
Moses must live; Pharaoh's plan, that Moses must die. Again we see the
successful issue of God's plan, and the overthrow of the human plan.
In carrying out his plan, God makes use of a mother's wit, a sister's
fidelity, a woman's curiosity, and a baby's tears. For all this read
carefully Exodus 2:1-10. These are the minute links in the chain of
God's providence which, welded together, restore that babe to his
mother's arms in less than twenty-four hours, now with the shield of
royalty protecting him. Had any one of these links broken, Moses' fate
might have been sealed.</p>

<p><b>35.</b> As illustrating these links, in a different sphere, read the
following: Professor Darwin tells that he noticed that pansies would
not grow wild near English villages, but would grow far away from
them. Investigation revealed that in English villages dogs go at
large. Where dogs go at large, cats must stay at home; where cats stay
at home, field-mice abound; where field-mice abound, bumblebees' nests
are destroyed; where bumblebees' nests are destroyed, there in no
fertilization of pollen. Therefore, where there are dogs, there are no
wild pansies. Apply this to the case in hand. No mother's wit, no ark
of bulrushes; no ark no sister's watch-care, and no chance to arouse
the curi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>osity of the princess. Therefore, no discovery of the babe
weeping. Consequently, no saving of the future deliverer of his
people. Thus God worked through natural agencies to thwart the decree
of Pharaoh. During these forty years Moses enjoyed all the educational
advantages of the most civilized nation of that day. So he was
prepared by the king himself to deliver the Hebrews from his control.</p>

<p><b>36. Life as Shepherd in the Desert.</b>&mdash;Moses' life at court came to a
sudden end, through his patriotic effort to deliver one of his race
from the cruelty of an Egyptian. As a result he had to flee for his
life, as even Pharaoh could not defend him for slaying one of the
ruling race for cruelty to a mere slave. For forty years we find him
on the Sinaitic peninsula, herding sheep. These must have been years
of deep thought. Often he must have wondered why God had given him
such deliverance, only to let him languish in the desert while at the
same time his people, whom he might have helped, were ground down
under the heel of the taskmaster. At the same time these years of
solitude must have been rich in opportunity for meditation and
communion upward. The city is not the best place for deep thought.
Elijah was no city man, neither was John the Baptist. In solitude
these men learned much that the city never could teach them.</p>

<p><b>37. Life as a Leader of God's People in the Desert.</b>&mdash;His
life of solitude came to a sudden close, when God called to him
out of the midst of the burning bush, and bade him return to
Egypt and deliver his people. At first Moses begged to be excused,
for he doubtless well remembered that because of his effort to
deliver <i>one</i> Hebrew, he had been an exile for forty years. How
then could he succeed in delivering <i>a nation</i>? But on God's
promise to be with him, he and his brother Aaron undertook the
task.</p>

<p><b>38.</b> Here we note the collision between God's plan and that of the
king. God's plan is, Let my people go. Pharaoh's plan is, they shall
stay right here. So the battle was joined. Note that Pharaoh, as a
result of the consecutive plagues, relents and tries compromises. For
these read carefully the story of the plagues, noting especially these
passages: Exodus 8:8, 15, 25,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> 32; Exodus 9:28, 35; Exodus 10:11, 20,
24, 28. And at last, when his pride is utterly broken, comes Exodus
12:31.</p>

<p><b>39.</b> Then came that night, much to be observed, on which
Israel marched out in triumph, while Egypt mourned, and Pharaoh
repented ever resisting the divine command. To this day
all Jews observe that great night, called the night of the Passover.</p>

<p><b>40.</b> Under the crags of Mount Sinai, Moses spent one year
with his people. That was a most significant year, as there he
received the ten commandments, and the instructions as to the
building of the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant. There,
too, he received directions as to the sacrifices that were to be
typical of that great sacrifice on Mount Calvary, hundreds of
years later. There, too, he had his bitter experience with his
people in the matter of the worship of the golden calf; a presage
of much that was to follow in the history of that wonderful but
stiffnecked people as they continued their journeys through the
wilderness.</p>

<p><b>41.</b> Mark in the life of this wonderful man the incredible contrast
between his highest and his lowest moods. In his agony over the
idolatry of his people while he was on the Mount receiving the ten
commandments, Moses pleads with God for them, and even goes so far as
to beg that, if need be, his own name might be blotted out of God's
book. If he or the people must perish, let it be he, and not the
people. This is most noble, and reminds one of what Paul later on
said, in the same strain (Rom. 9:1-3). Yet later on Moses yields to
incomprehensible murmuring, when the people have again transgressed.
"Moses was displeased. And Moses said unto Jehovah&mdash;Have I conceived
all this people?... that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy
bosom?... I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is
too heavy for me. And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee,
out of hand" (Num. 11:10-15). Is this the same man who speaks in the
matter of the golden calf, as we saw above? And in this extraordinary
fall we learn a lesson of humility and self-distrust. "Let him that
thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall."</p>

<p><b>42.</b> At last, after forty years of wandering, Israel is on the borders
of the Land of Promise, but on account of his unad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>vised speech, Moses
is not permitted to enter. On Mount Nebo he dies, alone, and there God
lays his body away until the great resurrection day.</p>

<p><b>43.</b> But again we see Moses. This time not outside of the Land of
Promise, but in the midst of it. On the Mount of Transfiguration he
appears, and this time with Israel's great prophet, Elijah, and with
Israel's Messiah. There they talk of the death so soon to be
accomplished in Jerusalem. Then he and the prophet return to the
spirit world.</p>

<p><b>44.</b> Yet once more Moses is brought to our attention. On the Isle of
Patmos, John in vision sees and hears much of what goes on in the
eternal world of bliss. And lo, he hears the ransomed sing the song of
Moses and the Lamb (Rev. 15:3). To this man is given the privilege
accorded to none other of the sons of men, to have his name coupled
with that of the Son of God in the glad songs of heaven. Truly a
privilege so exalted that we cannot possibly magnify it too much!</p>

<p><b>TIME.</b>&mdash;1458 B. C. to Samuel, 1121 B. C.</p>

<p><b>PLACES.</b>&mdash;Palestine.</p>

<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE OF EVENTS.</b>&mdash;The Jewish nation under Joshua achieved
success just so long as they obeyed fully the commands of God. The
Judges, as leaders, were direct representatives of God&mdash;who was
the actual head of the nation&mdash;and so far as God's laws were
strictly obeyed, the nation prospered.</p>


<h4>Joshua and the Judges</h4>

<p><b>45. Joshua Becomes Leader.</b>&mdash;At the death of Moses we see Israel on the
east side of the Jordan, opposite Jericho. Joshua<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> succeeds Moses as
leader. To him comes God's command, "Moses, my servant, is dead; now
therefore arise, go over this Jordan." (Josh. 1:2.) Note here no sign
of discouragement. Moses may be dead, but God still lives, and will
work through Joshua as well as through Moses. Notice in the orders
given by God to Joshua that no mention at all is made of sword, spear,
or bow, but only of obedience. This is emphasized again and again and
rightly, for in obedience to God's law lay Israel's hope (read Josh.
1:6-9).</p>

<p><b>46.</b> Now follows the contest for the possession of the land.
Jericho is taken, but at Ai defeat is experienced, on account of
disobedience. So Israel learns a costly but salutary lesson.
Then follows the conquest of the central part of Palestine, ending
at Shechem. Next in turn came southern Palestine, and then
the northern part of the land (Josh. 10:1 to 11). Yet at the
close of Joshua's life, not all of the land had been taken
possession of. Still the heathen tribes held on in various places;
and, indeed, they were not thoroughly subdued until the time
of David.</p>

<p><b>47. Reading the Laws of Moses.</b>&mdash;Worthy of note was the
great assemblage at Shechem, between the mountains of Ebal
and Gerizim, in the very center of the land, where the law of
Moses was read, with its blessings and curses, to all the people
(Josh. 8:30-35). Noteworthy also is the final address of the
aged Joshua to his people, at Shechem, beseeching them to obey
the law of Moses, recorded in chapter 24.</p>

<p><b>48. The Period of the Judges.</b>&mdash;After the death of Joshua, the
people seem to have become more or less disorganized. The
tribes ruled themselves&mdash;at times well, and at times ill. During
the times of the Judges the general trend of their history was as
follows: Israel would fall into sin, and then as a punishment
God allowed their foes whom they had spared to rule over them.
Then in due time Israel would "lament after the Lord," that is,
repent and call on the God of their fathers for deliverance. Then
God would allow them respite, and by the hand of some one of
the judges, whom he raised up, would give them deliverance
(see Judg. 2:11-18). The chronology of the book of Judges
is not very clear, and it is most probable that there were times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
when the "oppression" was not felt over all the land, but was
only sectional. Just the lines for a right chronology are uncertain.</p>

<p><b>49. Comparison of Periods of Oppression and Deliverance.</b>&mdash;Now if we
desire in a general way to judge as to the proportion of godliness as
compared with idolatry, that prevailed in these times, we can do so by
adding up the years of "oppression" and those of deliverance. This
will afford us a rough criterion as to the way in which Israel obeyed
and disobeyed their God. For remember that the "oppressions" were the
result of disobedience, while the "deliverances" were the result of
true repentance. Worked out in this way, we have the following
statement, in which the name stands for the country to which the
people were in temporary bondage:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mesopotamia, bondage 8 years,&mdash;rest 32 years.<br />
Moab, bondage 18 years,&mdash;rest 22 years.<br />
Canaan, bondage 20 years,&mdash;rest 20 years.<br />
Midian, bondage 7 years,&mdash;rest 32 years.<br />
Philistia and Ammon, bondage 18 years,&mdash;rest 7, 10, and 8 years.<br />
Philistia, bondage 40 years,&mdash;rest 20 years.</p></div>

<p>Adding all these up, we find that the people were in bondage in
whole or in part for 111 years, while they had "rest" as the
result of their repentance for 151 years. Without pressing this
mathematical calculation too far, we must nevertheless conclude
that for more than half the time the nation at large obeyed God
fairly well.</p>

<p><b>50. Great Leaders among the Judges.</b>&mdash;Deborah and
Barak, who, by their combined forces drove out the oppressors
of Canaan, under Jabin their king. This man had mightily
oppressed the people, he having nine hundred chariots of iron,
against which poor Israel could bring no corresponding force.
Yet when the Lord's time came, he was able to overthrow the
armies of Jabin, through the courage and combination of the two
persons named. Then the land had rest for forty years. (For
a wonderful setting of the song of triumph that Deborah and
Barak sang, let the student turn to Professor Moulton's "Literary
Study of the Bible," pp. 133-142.)</p>

<p><b>51.</b> After this came the terrible oppression of the Midianites,
who, with their camels, their flocks, and herds came on the land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
like grasshoppers, and ate up everything. Fortunately this
oppression lasted only for seven years, otherwise there would
have been nothing left. The deliverance from the hosts of
Midian came through Gideon, whose three hundred men with
torches and trumpets wrought havoc among the Midianite army.
What the three hundred at Thermopyl&aelig; were to Greece, that
this three hundred were to the people of Israel.</p>

<p><b>52.</b> Another terrible experience of Israel was that which came to them
in connection with their oldtime foes, the Philistines and the
Ammonites. Study the story as told in Judges 10:6-18, together with
the narrative of their deliverance under Jephthah. Here the student
will see clearly set forth the cause of the "oppression," verses 6-9,
and the cause of the deliverance, verses 10-18. Jephthah was a rude
man of his times, but then we must realize that rude times call for
violent men.</p>

<p><b>53.</b> The only other case to which attention is called here that
of the longest of all the periods of oppression,&mdash;the second
under the Philistines, which lasted forty years. Here it was
Samson who was to deliver the people from the iron hand of the
Philistines, and it took the iron hand of a Samson to do the work.</p>

<p><b>54. Not a Time of National Unity.</b>&mdash;During all these many
years, the government of the people was largely that of the
tribal leaders. There was not the national unity that we saw in
the days of their two great leaders, Moses and Joshua. Nor was
there the same unity of action that came later on under the kings.
But none the less, the great need of the people during these
years was not so much political as religious. Had they only
obeyed the commands of God as given to Moses, and as reiterated
by the angel of the Lord to Joshua, God would not have permitted
them to be ground under the heel of their oppressors as they
were. We fail to read the story aright unless we seize the truth
that righteousness exalts a people, while sin is a reproach to any
nation. This truth has its modern as well as its ancient application.</p>

<img src="images/illus-044.png" width="100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><b>LEADING PERSONS</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Samuel.</b>&mdash;The connecting link between the times of the Judges and of
the kings (1 Sam. 1-8).</p>

<p><b>Saul.</b>&mdash;First king, who made a good beginning (1 Sam. 10:1-27). He
united the people, breaking down factions. Spurned Samuel's advice (1
Sam. 15:1-35). He became jealous of David, and angered at his own son,
Jonathan (1 Sam. 18:8 to 19:11). Rejected by God as king (1 Sam. 15).
Killed in battle at Gilboa (1 Sam. 31:1-13).</p>

<p><b>David.</b>&mdash;A shepherd boy, noted for bravery (1 Sam. 16-31). Chosen king
and ruled over Judah seven years (2 Sam. 2). Then became king over all
Israel, and greatly enlarged the nation's borders. Made Jerusalem the
capital (2 Sam. 5:6-9). A great religious leader and composer of
Psalms. Sinned against Uriah (2 Sam. 11:1 to 12:14). His son Absalom
rebelled (2 Sam. 15 to 18).</p>

<p><b>Solomon.</b>&mdash;Son of David. Began his reign with a wise choice (1 Kings
3). Built the Temple in Jerusalem (1 Kings 5). Sinned in his marriages
(1 Kings 11). He was noted for his great wisdom and riches. He lived
in luxury, the people were heavily taxed, and the outward prosperity
was accompanied by inward spiritual decay. See Samuel's warning in 1
Samuel 8:1-18.</p>

<p><b>Other Persons.</b>&mdash;Goliath, the Philistine giant, whom David
slew.&mdash;Jonathan, Saul's son, a great friend of David.</p></div>

<p><b>PLACES.</b>&mdash;Mizpeh, Socoh, Gilboa, Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>

<b>TIME.</b>&mdash;1121 B. C. to 983 B. C.</p>

<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE OF EVENTS.</b>&mdash;David's reign as king brought
the people to the place of their greatest national success, and
David's reign and that of Solomon were politically the best
in all Israel's history. David was signally honored in becoming
an ancestor of Mary, the mother of Jesus.</p>


<h4>The United Kingdom. Saul, David, Solomon</h4>

<p><b>55. Israel Asks for a King.</b>&mdash;Ostensibly because Samuel's sons were
worthless men, but also and largely because they wished to be "like
the nations around them," Israel asked the prophet Samuel to appoint a
king over them. This Samuel was reluctant to do. But commanded by God
to acquiesce, he anointed Saul, the son of Kish, to be king over
Israel. That God did not consider the change from government by judges
to government by kings to be an improvement, is apparent from his
saying, "they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them"
(1 Sam. 8:7).</p>

<p><b>56. The First King, Saul.</b>&mdash;Saul found the nation somewhat
disorganized, and split into many factions. His task was to
unite the people, so that they could show a bold and successful
front against their foes. Prominent among these foes were the
Philistines, who lived on the southwest of Israel, and who were
a courageous and persistent folk. In all this work Saul was
somewhat successful. He began well, but before very long,
owing to self-will, he swerved aside from the advice of the aged
Samuel. During his reign the great war with the Philistines
took place in which Goliath and David figured so dramatically
(1 Sam. 17).</p>

<p><b>57.</b> Saul's evil disposition grew worse and worse, showing
itself in his twice-repeated effort to kill David and his one effort
to kill his own son Jonathan for his friendship for David (see
1 Sam. 18:10, 11; 19:10; 20:32, 33). On account of his distinct
disobedience to God's command, and his hypocrisy, God rejected
him from being king (1 Sam. 15). Still Saul continued to rule
for some years. Then came the end when, in battle with his old
foes, the Philistines, Saul and his sons fell, near Mount Gilboa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
(1 Sam. 31). He ruled about forty years, and was a sad instance
of a man who began well, who had a superb counselor in Samuel,
but who, through self-will and disobedience, perished at last
most miserably.</p>

<p><b>58. David Becomes King.</b>&mdash;After the death of Saul, Judah turned to
David as its rightful leader and king. He was therefore anointed at
Hebron as king of Judah. Seven years later the remainder of the tribes
came to him and asked him to rule over them. This he did, and in this
way he was king over <i>all</i> Israel for thirty-three years. His
remarkable character and executive ability soon showed itself. His
reign was most successful, and he enlarged the bounds of the kingdom
to their utmost extent. It extended from the Red Sea and Egypt to the
Euphrates, as promised by God (Gen. 15:18 and Josh. 1:4). He captured
Jerusalem and made it the political and the religious capital of the
nation (2 Sam. 5:6-9). Thither he brought up the Ark of the Covenant,
and here he established the worship of Jehovah. He organized the whole
of the ritual of worship, and formed choirs of singers to make a glad
noise unto the Lord. Everywhere he brought order out of chaos, and
made the name of Israel one to be feared by the surrounding nations.
Thus to the Israelite both of his day and of subsequent centuries he
became their ideal king.</p>

<p><b>59.</b> His later life was saddened by his own sin in the matter
of Uriah and Bathsheba, where he erred most grievously. In
recalling this sin, and in condemning the king for it, we must also
bear in mind his true repentance, and also recognize that in his
time there was no king who would have thought it worth while
to give a second thought to the whole matter (see 2 Sam. 11:1-12:14).</p>

<p><b>60. The Rebellion of Absalom.</b>&mdash;The end of David's life
was further embittered by the rebellion of his favorite son,
Absalom. This nearly brought David to a violent death. Only
the indomitable spirit that the king possessed, together with
the ability of his chief general Joab, saved the day (2 Sam.
15-18). David was Israel's sweet singer. He composed many
Psalms, which have come down to us as specimens of his poetic
ability. (The writer is, of course, aware that some modern critics<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
deny that any of the Psalms are by David, but he has never
seen any conclusive proof of this.)</p>

<p><b>61.</b> In general, until his later years, when too much prosperity
had dulled his spiritual life, David's character was singularly
pure and unselfish. His dealings with Saul while the latter was
seeking his life show a most chivalrous spirit, in that twice he
spared his enemy's life when he had him in his power (1 Sam.
24:1-22; 26:1-25). In his friendship for Jonathan he shows
an affection which, reciprocated by Jonathan, constitutes one of
the classic friendships of history. Taken all in all, and remembering
the times in which he lived, David was perhaps the finest
king that the world ever saw.</p>

<p><b>62. Solomon.</b>&mdash;On David's death his son Solomon ascended
the throne. Bathsheba was his mother. He began his reign
well. When God gave him his choice between riches and wisdom,
he chose the latter (1 Kings 3:5-15). He it was who carried out
David's plan for a "magnifical" temple in Jerusalem, where
he built the most splendid temple that the world had so far seen.
His prayer at the dedication of the temple is a most remarkable
one (1 Kings 8). His fame spread through the world, and on one
occasion the Queen of Sheba, in Arabia, journeyed over one
thousand miles to make him a visit. Her astonishment at what
she saw and heard in Jerusalem is told in 1 Kings 10. In amazement
she cries out, "Howbeit I believed not the words, until I
came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not
told me; thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I
heard."</p>

<p><b>63.</b> But alas! Solomon did not continue as well as he began.
To enhance his glory and extend his political power, he made
alliances with idolatrous sovereigns. He married the daughter
of Pharaoh, and besides this had multitudes of wives, who led
his heart astray (1 Kings 11:1-8). God's warning, given in
the same chapter, seems to have been disregarded.</p>

<p><b>64. Samuel's Warnings come True.</b>&mdash;In Solomon all the warnings of
Samuel as to what would come on the nation if they persisted in their
choice of a king were fulfilled (1 Sam. 8:1-18). He also disregarded
what God had said through the mouth of Moses, as recorded in
Deuteronomy 17:14-20. He multiplied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> taxes to such a degree that the
people were not able to bear them. His court life was most luxurious
and enervating, and the demands of his wives for all manner of
indulgences were continuous. In this way, though there was much
outward prosperity, the seeds of decay were sown with prodigal hands.
Of course the end of such a policy could be only disaster, though the
king in his mad search after power and luxury failed to see the
approaching storm. However wise he may have been, as shown in his
proverbs, he lacked that practical wisdom which begins in the fear of
God. He went steadily down hill, and only his fame, and his reputation
as being the son of David, saved him from overthrow. But immediately
on his death the consequences of his misrule showed themselves in a
most pronounced way, in the disruption of the kingdom. Like Saul and
David, he also ruled over Israel for forty years.</p>

<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE OF EVENTS.</b>&mdash;God's unceasing efforts to save
his people from their sins are marked by the sending of
prophets, like Elijah and Elisha, at a time when wicked
kings had led the people into abominable idolatry.</p>


<h4>The Divided Kingdom. Israel, or the Northern Kingdom</h4>

<p><b>65. Rehoboam Becomes King.</b>&mdash;After the death of Solomon
his son Rehoboam ascended the throne. At once there came to
him a delegation headed by Jeroboam, asking for relief from the
intolerable taxation that Solomon had levied. Rehoboam,
guided by the foolish counsel of his hot-headed young men,
replied roughly, saying, "my little finger is thicker than my
father's loins" (1 Kings 12:1-20). At once the men of Israel
revolted, and set up Jeroboam to be their king. From that time
on, to the end, the kingdom was divided, and many times the
one part was antagonistic to the other.</p>

<p><b>66. The Northern Kingdom.</b>&mdash;Jeroboam as its first king,
fearing that if the religion of the two peoples remained substantially
the same, and if his people went regularly to Jerusalem,
the capital of the Southern Kingdom, to worship, they would be
alienated from him, devised a system of calf worship, and set
up two golden calves, the one at Bethel, just over the border of
Judah, and the other at Dan, in the extreme north of his domain.
To these two centers of worship he invited his people to resort,
in order to keep them from assembling with the men of Judah
in Jerusalem. "It is too much for you," he said, "to go so far
as to Jerusalem; behold your gods right in your midst" (1 Kings
12:25-33). All this he did in utter defiance of God's command,
"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image," and in
spite of the bitter experience of Israel in the wilderness in the
matter of the golden calf that Aaron made.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p><b>67.</b> This action on the part of Jeroboam "set the pace" for
the Northern Kingdom, and from that day to the end of their
history the land was full of gross idolatry. Not that all the
men of the Northern Kingdom refused to follow Jehovah, for this
was not the case, but the rulers were leaders in one form or
another of idolatry.</p>

<p><b>68. Ahab and Jezebel.</b>&mdash;In 925 B. C. Ahab ascended the throne of the
Northern Kingdom. He married Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal, king of
the Sidonians, a most masterful and wicked woman. She led her husband
to establish the worship of Baal and Ashtoreth, nature divinities,
whose worship was connected with most abhorrent practises. Not only
so, but between them they did their best to root out all those who
persisted in the worship of the God of Abraham. They persecuted the
sons of the prophets, and put them to the sword. It was now no longer
safe to try, even in secret, to worship the God of truth.</p>

<p><b>69. Elijah and Elisha.</b>&mdash;It was just at this time that God in
his mercy sent two very great prophets to Israel to try to win
them back to their allegiance to the God of Moses and the Patriarchs.
This, the student will remember, was one of those periods
which was mentioned in the introduction, in which the narrative
is amplified and the miracle multiplied, as betokening that the
period was of great importance. Elijah and his successor,
Elisha, did their best to stay the downward tendency of their
people, but quite largely in vain. For a while it seemed as
though there was to be some real reformation. But it did not
last long, and soon the people, led astray by their rulers, lapsed
into idolatry once more.</p>

<p><b>70. Jehu.</b>&mdash;The one bright spot in all this sad story of the
decline of the Northern Kingdom is found in the story of Jehu,
891 B. C. (2 Kings 9, 10.)  He dealt drastically with the
worshipers of Baal, and tried his best to put a final stop to all
Baal worship. He ruled about twenty-eight years. His son
Jehoahaz continued the sin of calf worship, and led his people
once more into the downward path.</p>

<p><b>71.</b> Under <b>Jeroboam the Second</b> the Northern Kingdom
attained much outward prosperity, but its spiritual life did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
improve at all. Men became greedy of gain, and worldliness
and sin of gross description gained the upper hand. It was possibly
during this reign that God sent the prophet Amos to bear witness
against the sins of the rulers and people. At this point read the
prophecy of Amos, and try to realize how earnestly he pleaded
with the men of Israel to return to the worship of the God of
their fathers. But it was all in vain. Israel was joined to his
idols.</p>

<p><b>72. Hosea</b>, too, comes at about this same time, and he did
his best to win Israel back from their apostasy. He has well
been called the "pleading prophet," for his tenderness is most
touching. Yet all in vain were his pleas. Israel would have
none of them.</p>

<p><b>73. Hoshea, Last of the Kings.</b>&mdash;At last the Divine patience
seems to have been exhausted, and God gave the Northern
Kingdom over into the hands of its enemies, and they were
marched off into captivity. Hoshea is the last of the kings of
Israel, and during his rule the King of Assyria captured Samaria,
and led the people off into a strange land. Here let the student
carefully read 2 Kings 17:1-41 to see the r&eacute;sum&eacute; that the sacred
writer gives of the reasons for the final catastrophe that befell
Israel. It was on account of their sins that they were suffered
to experience these dire disasters.</p>

<p><b>74.</b> In the place of the deported people, the Assyrians, in
accordance with the customs of those days, placed peoples from
alien lands in their stead. In this manner the population of
Samaria became much mixed, and the false worship of these
idolatrous peoples became the religion of the land of the Patriarchs
in its northern portion. This will account for the hostility
between Jew and Samaritan which we find in the days of Nehemiah,
and even as late as the times of our Lord.</p>

</div>

<p><b>LEADING PERSONS</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Abijam.</b>&mdash;Son of Rehoboam. Reigned three years (1 Kings
15:1-8).</p>

<p><b>Asa.</b>&mdash;Son of Abijam. Reigned forty-one years (1 Kings
15:9-24). Made some effort as a reformer.</p>

<p><b>Jehoshaphat.</b>&mdash;Son of Asa. Brought Judah great success
(2 Chron. 17:1 to 20:37).</p>

<p><b>Jehoram.</b>&mdash;Did evil like unto Ahab (2 Chron. 21:6). Ahaziah followed (2
Chron. 22:4) and was succeeded by Queen Athaliah, worse than her
predecessors (2 Chron. 22:10 to 23:15).</p>

<p><b>Joash</b> was a very good ruler; he began his reign at seven years
of age. Repaired the Temple (2 Chron. 24:1-27).</p>

<p><b>Amaziah, Uzziah, Jotham.</b>&mdash;Not remarkable in any way
(2 Chron. 25:1 to 27:9).</p>

<p><b>Ahaz.</b>&mdash;An evil king; caused his children to pass through the
fire to idols (2 Chron. 28:3).</p>

<p><b>Hezekiah</b> was the best king so far (2 Chron. 29:1 to
32:33). Isaiah was influential and the Passover was
restored.</p>

<p><b>Manasseh</b> was the worst king in many ways, putting an
idol in the Holy of Holies (2 Chron. 33:1-20; 2 Kings 21:1-18).</p>

<p><b>Josiah</b> was a good ruler, beginning
at eight years of age.
The Temple was repaired,
the Law was read, and
reform was established (2
Kings 22:1 to 23:30).</p>

<p><b>Zedekiah.</b>&mdash;After Josiah's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>reign matters grew worse until under Zedekiah captivity
came (2 Kings 25:1-21).</p>

<p><b>Outside Nations</b> that played their part in this catastrophe
were Assyria, Babylon, Syria, Egypt.</p></div>

<p><b>TIME.</b>&mdash;966 B. C. to 588 B. C.</p>

<p><b>PLACES.</b>&mdash;Judah, Jerusalem, Babylonia.</p>

<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE OF EVENTS.</b>&mdash;The influence of leadership
is shown in a marked degree in the history of Judah; "like
king, like people." It was many times demonstrated that
one good man could turn the whole nation God-ward. At
last, as in the case of Israel, Judah is given into captivity.</p>


<h4>The Divided Kingdom. Judah, the Southern Kingdom</h4>

<p><b>75. The Kingdom of Judah</b> lasted one hundred and thirty
years longer than that of Israel. This was largely owing to the
greater loyalty of Judah to the law of God. Nevertheless even
under the rule of Rehoboam, their first king, Judah showed an
evil tendency to depart from the law of God (1 Kings 14:21-24).
There is no record, however, that Rehoboam officially tried to
influence the people toward idolatry, as did Jeroboam. Probably
the very fact that the temple was in the capital of Judah held
him and the people, in some measure at least, to the right manner
of worship. Abijam, Rehoboam's son, followed in the footsteps
of his father. But his son, Asa, was a much better man, and
he made efforts at reform. Though he was not sufficiently
radical in his work, he was a great improvement on his predecessors.</p>

<p><b>76.</b> Under <b>Jehoshaphat</b> Judah reached the height of her
power. "He walked in the first ways of his father David, and
sought not unto the Baalim" (2 Chron. 17 to 20:37. Also
1 Kings 22:41-50).</p>

<p><b>77.</b> Once more, under <b>Joash</b>, Judah enjoyed a sovereign who
had in him much of godliness. He repaired the temple and
did much to restore the true worship of God.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p><b>78.</b> After a period of varying vicissitudes we find Ahaz on
the throne of Judah. He did that which was evil in the sight
of the Lord, and caused his son to pass through the fire, i. e., he
sacrificed him to heathen idols. He introduced calf worship,
and set up "high places," for false worship on every hill and
under every green tree (2 Kings 16:1-4). Had it not been
that his son Hezekiah was more godly than he, the doom of
Judah might have been much hastened. During his reign Israel
was carried captive.</p>

<p><b>79.</b> Under <b>Hezekiah</b>, however, we see great reforms going on.
He removed the high places, cut down the groves, and even
brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made, for to
it the people had been offering incense (2 Kings 18:1-8). He
was the best of all the kings of Judah, and had his successors
followed in his footsteps, there need have been no captivity of
Judah to record. In his reign it was that God gave Judah signal
deliverance from the hosts of Sennacherib.</p>

<p><b>80.</b> Alas! that so godly a king should have been followed by
so worthless a man as his son <b>Manasseh</b>. He was perhaps the
very worst of all the kings of Judah. Now we see the high places
rebuilt, and idolatrous altars to Baal established. But more than
this. He went farther than any before him, in that he took the
Ark of the Covenant out of the Most Holy Place, and put there
a graven image. So the record says that Manasseh did more to
seduce the people to sin than all the nations whom the Lord
removed to make place for his people. Truly a dreadful record
for one who sat on the throne of David.</p>

<p><b>81.</b> Once more the people have respite, however, for <b>Josiah</b>, Manasseh's
grandson, was a very different type. He was only eight years old when
he began to reign, but he tried to do that which was right in the
sight of God. The deserted temple was repaired, the law was discovered
and studied, the Covenant was publicly renewed, the idol in the Most
Holy Place was taken away, and burned with fire, and the high places
were largely destroyed. Moreover, he broke down the altar at Bethel
that Jeroboam had originally erected. He re-established the
celebration of the feast of the Passover, which had long been
neglected. His efforts at reform were extended even to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> dominions
of the Northern Kingdom, though with no permanent effect (see for all
this 2 Chron. 34, 35, and 2 Kings 22:1 to 23:28).</p>

<p><b>82.</b> From the time of the death of Josiah, the downward
tendency of Judah was steadfast. At last the end, long delayed
through the mercy of God, came, and under Jehoiachin the
overthrow was complete, and under his son Jehoiakim Judah
was marched off in captivity to the land of Babylon. Thus
sadly was fulfilled all that God had warned his people of, and
the day of retribution came just as predicted.</p>

<p><b>83. Other Nations.</b>&mdash;In all this sad drama of course outside
nations played a prominent part. Assyria, Babylon, Syria,
Egypt, all come into view. But none of them could have wrought
the havoc that they did had it not been for the recreant part that
Israel on the north and Judah on the south played. He who
brought them all out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an
outstretched arm could and would have delivered them from
all their foes had they been loyal to him. All the blessings of
Deuteronomy 28:1-14 might have been theirs had they only
hearkened to the commandments of God by the mouth of his
servant Moses. But as it was, all the dreadful curses of Deuteronomy
28:15-68 (be sure to read these passages) came on them,
and all on account of their idolatry and vileness.</p>

<p><b>84. Isaiah and Jeremiah.</b>&mdash;Nor did the kings and people sin
thus grievously because they had no prophets to warn them.
Just as God sent Elijah, Elisha, Amos, and Hosea to warn and
woo the Northern Kingdom, so he sent the great Isaiah and
Jeremiah to warn the men of the Southern Kingdom. Plainer
warnings, grander promises, better counsels than these prophets
gave, have never been uttered by human lips. For about sixty
years, beginning in the reign of Uzziah, Isaiah pleaded with the
nation. He lived and prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah,
Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, and all through these days he was
faithful to his mission. Sometimes he was heeded, and sometimes
he was scoffed at, but ever and always he was faithful.
So too was Jeremiah, whom nothing could turn from the integrity
of his course. For the most part mocked at, traduced and
ridiculed by the leaders, these men were helpless, for the minds
and hearts of rulers and people were set on mischief. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
though hand joined in hand, evil was sure not to go unpunished,
and so the end came.</p>

<p><b>85. Captivity.</b>&mdash;What a contrast between Israel marching
triumphantly into the land, and Israel (and later on, Judah)
marching out of the land in chains and humiliation! Through
faith they conquered Jericho, and through lack of faith they
themselves were at last conquered, and taken off into a land of
shame and sorrow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<h4>Elijah, the Great Speaking Prophet</h4>

<p><b>86. Elijah's Mission.</b>&mdash;All the prophets spoke, though some
of them wrote as well, like Isaiah and others. We call Elijah
a speaking prophet because we have but one record (2 Chron.
21:12-15) of anything that he wrote. Elijah was sent by God
to the Northern Kingdom at the time of Ahab and Jezebel, to try
and stay the tide of idolatry that was threatening to overwhelm
the land. Ahab and Jezebel had established the worship of
Baal and Ashtoreth, two nature divinities of the heathen
world. To turn back this tendency God sent this man of the desert.
Of his early life we know nothing. He appears before us
suddenly, as a man in the full tide of life. He was from Gilead,
and a man of action, most emphatically. To get a good idea of
the man, we may set him forth as seen in six notable scenes.</p>

<p><b>87. First Scene:</b> Elijah and Ahab.&mdash;This is where he meets
the king, and announces that as the God of Israel lives, there
shall not be dew or rain in all the land, excepting at the word of
the prophet. Note here the significant nature of this challenge.
The two divinities that the people were now forced to worship
were supposed to preside over the processes of nature. Just in
their realm of influence, therefore, Elijah challenges them, and
claims that his God has given to him power over the forces of
nature, such as neither Baal nor Ashtoreth possessed. Then
Elijah disappears, no one knows whither.</p>

<p><b>88.</b> Now follows the fulfilment of his prediction. The season
for the early and for the latter rain comes and goes, and still
there is no rain. Probably some said, "This is unusual, but of
course things will even up next year, and we shall have an abundance
of rain." But the next year came and went, and still the
heavens were as brass. Ahab now tries to discover this man
who holds the key of the heaven, that he may force him to unlock
the clouds. But in vain. The third year comes and goes, and
still there is no rain, while the land is dry and parched, and even
the king finds it hard to get food for his horses. At the same
time there are some who call attention to the most unwonted
fact that not only has there been no rain, but that even the
dew has not been seen for three years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p><b>89. Second Scene.</b>&mdash;Now comes the second encounter between
the prophet and the enraged monarch. Most dramatic is this
brief interview, in which Ahab charges Elijah with troubling
Israel, and Elijah throws the charge back in his teeth. Then
comes the further challenge on the part of the prophet to the
priests of these two nature divinities, to test their power on
Mount Carmel. The scene there is too familiar to need detailed
description. Suffice it to remind the student that Baal's priests
were powerless to make good their claim that their gods held
control over the forces of nature. Elijah, however, proves that
Jehovah is the God of nature, and holds all things in his hands,
for his prayer is answered by fire, and the sacrifice is consumed,
with the wood and the water and the very dust that lay around
so abundantly. Now comes the confession of the people that
Jehovah and not Baal is the true God. Then comes the rain at
Elijah's petition, and the second great scene in the life of this
man closes.</p>

<p><b>90. Third Scene.</b>&mdash;Very different is this from either of the two
others. We see this man sitting discouraged under a juniper tree, and
asking God to take away his life, as he is not better than his
fathers. Is this the same hero whom we saw standing in all his triumph
before the king? Yes, the same. How then account for the difference in
his mien? Probably because of the reaction that came after the
exciting contest with the priests of Baal, and the consciousness that
he had not won as great a victory for Jehovah as he had anticipated.
For as soon as the prophets of Baal had been slain, Jezebel, instead
of yielding, had sent word to Elijah that she would kill him within
twenty-four hours. It was this apparent failure that most probably
discouraged the prophet, so that all his work seemed to him to have
come to naught. Note now how God comforts his servant, how he
ministers to his body, by food and rest, and to his mind by assuring
him that he is wrong in thinking that he only remains as a true
worshiper of Jehovah. Furthermore, God sends him to Horeb, where Moses
learned so many lessons in things divine, and there God speaks to
Elijah and gives him further work to do, so that when the prophet
comes forth from his communion with God, he is again the stern man of
duty that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> he was before. (Three great men learned much at Horeb:
Moses, Elijah, and Paul the Apostle, for when he went to Arabia, it
was probably Horeb to which he journeyed.)</p>

<p><b>91. Fourth Scene.</b>&mdash;Again Elijah and Ahab are face to face. Ahab has
coveted the vineyard of Naboth, to make out of it a garden of herbs.
Naboth, as was his right, would not part with the inheritance of his
fathers. Ahab does not dare use violence to secure possession. But
Jezebel has no such scruples. With bribery and perjury, she soon has
poor Naboth convicted of blasphemy, and stoned to death. Then his
estate passing to the crown, she tells her husband to arise and take
possession. Just as Ahab reaches the vineyard, lo! Elijah confronts
him. The prophet was the last man whom the conscience-stricken king
desired to see, particularly at that very moment. "Hast thou found me,
O mine enemy?" he exclaims, in horror. Then comes the righteous
prophet's stern denunciation of the guilty king, and so the interview
closes.</p>

<p><b>92. Fifth Scene.</b>&mdash;Now we are in the country east of the Jordan. Two
men are journeying together, and we recognize them as Elijah and his
successor Elisha. Suddenly there comes a supernatural rushing of what
seem to be chariots and horses of fire. The elder of the two is caught
up, and carried into heaven, while the younger, in amazement and awe,
cries out, "My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the
horsemen thereof!" As suddenly as Elijah came to the scenes of his
activity, so suddenly did he disappear.</p>

<p><b>93. Sixth Scene.</b>&mdash;More quiet than any of the others is this scene. We
are now on the Mount of Transfiguration. The Master is there, and
three of his disciples. Suddenly there appear two others in glory with
the Master. They are the great lawgiver, Moses, and the great prophet,
Elijah. They are talking with Jesus of his death which was now soon to
take place in Jerusalem. Then, the conversation having come to a
close, the two visitors from the other world disappear, and the Master
is left alone with his astonished disciples.</p>

<p><b>94.</b> Stern, with the fear of God before his eyes, and no fear of man in
his heart, stands this man of God, Elijah. A benediction to Israel God
meant him to be, but alas! Israel rejected him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> as it did the other
prophets whom God in his mercy sent, and so Israel pushed on to its
own final ruin. For the material used in this sketch look at 1 Kings
17, 18, 19, 21, and 2 Kings 2.</p>

<p><b>LEADING EVENTS AND PERSONS</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Return from Captivity.</b>&mdash;After seventy years, Cyrus, king of Persia,
allowed the Jews to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the Temple under
Zerubbabel (Ezra 1:1-11). Altar set up once more (Ezra 3:1-7). The
Temple begun (Ezra 3:8, and following passages). The prophets Haggai
and Zechariah encouraged the people (see books under their names).</p>

<p><b>Sixty years</b> elapsed of which we know nothing.</p>

<p><b>Ezra goes</b> to Jerusalem to institute reforms, such as
prohibiting mixed marriages of Jews with other nations
(Ezra 7:1 to 9:15). He interpreted the law (Neh. 8:1-18)
and celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles.</p>

<p><b>Nehemiah</b>, cup-bearer to Artaxerxes, the king. Became solicitous for
the city of Jerusalem and its broken walls, prayed for guidance, and
was rewarded by the king's assistance (Neh. 1:1 to 2:8). Opposed by
Sanballat (Neh. 2:19, 20; 4:1-8; 6:1-14). A great popular religious
festival was held (Neh. 8:1-18). Judah was set apart from strangers
(Neh. 9:1-38; 13:1-3). The law of the Sabbath was enforced (Neh.
13:15-22).</p></div>

<p><b>TIME.</b>&mdash;538 B. C. to about 400 B. C.</p>

<p><b>PLACES.</b>&mdash;Babylon, Jerusalem.</p>

<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE OF EVENTS.</b>&mdash;The return to Jerusalem and the institution
of reforms were events of tremendous import to the Jews, and the faithfulness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>of a few men was given high recognition. The rebuilding
of the Temple and reconstruction of the city walls
looked forward through four centuries to the fitting setting
for the scene of the coming Messiah.</p>


<h4>The Captivity and the Return</h4>

<p><b>95. Condition During Captivity.</b>&mdash;The captivity of Judah
lasted seventy years, dating from the first captivity under
Jehoiakim, 605 B. C., when among others Daniel was taken
captive. The lot of the captives in Babylon was bad enough,
but it was not by any means as severe as the bondage in Egypt.
Quite a number of the captives, such as Daniel, Zerubbabel,
Nehemiah, occupied positions of great trust and emolument.
Still, by the rivers of Babylon, Judah did mourn and weep, as
her people thought of Jerusalem and its vanished glories.</p>

<p><b>96. The Return.</b>&mdash;The seventy years having been completed God stirred
up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, and he issued a decree
allowing all Jews who so desired to return to their own land. He also
gave them many vessels of gold and silver that Nebuchadrezzar had
taken from the Temple, that they might use them in the new house of
God which they were to build. Zerubbabel led the caravan from Babylon
to Jerusalem. Arrived in Jerusalem, they began their work by erecting
the altar first. This was right, as the altar was the foundation of
all the temple services. Altars existed long before temples had been
built. For a while the building of the temple was interrupted by the
foes of Judah, but at last it was completed, the people being
encouraged by the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. So they dedicated the
temple with much joy, and restored the sacrifices as Moses, the man of
God, had commanded. For all of this see Ezra 1-6 and the books of
Haggai and Zechariah.</p>

<p><b>97. Ezra.</b>&mdash;Now comes a period of about 60 years, in which we have no
knowledge of the condition of affairs in Jerusalem. At last, however,
Ezra, the scribe, goes up to the Holy City, and with him a number of
patriotic Jews. The work of Zerubbabel was the rebuilding of the
temple. That of Ezra was emphatically the reformation of religion
among those who were in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> Judah and Jerusalem. There was much danger
that through intermarriages with the people of the land the Jews would
again abandon the religion of their fathers. A large part of Ezra's
effort was aimed against this evil. The people declared their
willingness to do as Ezra dictated, and so the danger from this
direction was for the time being avoided.</p>

<p><b>98. Nehemiah.</b>&mdash;Soon after this we come to the story of Nehemiah. He
was cupbearer to Artaxerxes, a position of much ease and wealth. But
the welfare of Jerusalem lay near his heart, and he made it his
business to know how matters were progressing in that city. Certain of
his brethren at one time brought him evil tidings from there. In
consequence he betook himself to prayer that God would give him such
favor in the eyes of the king that he would allow him to go to
Jerusalem and build the walls that had been thrown down. In those days
a city without walls was in a pitiful condition, exposed to the
assaults of all its foes. For four months Nehemiah prayed without any
visible answer. Then it came at last in a moment. One day at the table
the king noticed that the face of his cupbearer was sad. "Why is thy
countenance sad?" he inquired. Then Nehemiah (after an instant of
silent prayer) told the king all that was in his heart. At once the
permission was given him for which he had waited and prayed for four
months. So off he started as soon as possible.</p>

<p><b>99. Nehemiah's Prayer.</b>&mdash;Note just here the nature of
Nehemiah's prayer. It was not like so many modern prayers,
one for <i>ease</i>. No, it was a prayer for opportunity to make <i>sacrifice</i>
and bear <i>heavy burdens</i> for the sake of Jerusalem. If all the
church were in this day to pray for an opportunity to bear
burdens and make sacrifices, what do you think the effect would
be on the advance of the kingdom of God on earth?</p>

<p>No sooner did Nehemiah reach Jerusalem than he inspected
the walls to see exactly the condition in which they were. Then
he assembled the rulers and told them of his plans, and heartened
them for the work. He divided the work among the families,
thus giving each one a specific task, and encouraging the spirit
of true rivalry. "To every man his work," seems to have been
his excellent motto. So the people got to work with enthusiasm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p><b>100. Opposition.</b>&mdash;Of course there was no lack of opposition, for all
good causes have opponents. But none of these things in any way moved
this grand man from his purpose, or abated in any degree his
enthusiasm. With sword in one hand and trowel in the other the people
pushed the work forward, while over all Nehemiah watched with
unceasing care. His vigilance is apparent from the fact that for
nearly two months he never put off his clothes. So in fifty-two days
the work was completed, and the people's hearts were filled with joy.
Under his rule was gathered what has sometimes been called the first
Sunday-school on record (Neh. 8). He knew that it was on account of
the ignorance of the people of the Word that they fell so easily into
sin. So he gathered them all together, and Ezra read and explained the
law of Moses in their hearing. In this connection, too, they
celebrated the feast of tabernacles, in commemoration of the
wanderings of Israel in the wilderness.</p>

<p><b>101.</b> Ever watchful of the spiritual welfare of his people, Nehemiah
instituted reforms in the matter of Sabbath-keeping, and
of usury, and of idolatrous intermarriages with the people of
the land. His labors never ceased, for he seems to have realized
that "eternal vigilance" was the price of true godliness, in the
midst of idolatrous surroundings.</p>

<p><b>102. Results of the Captivity.</b>&mdash;In this matter of the captivity,
the most important thing for us to bear in mind is that
the people were cured by their experience of all forms of idolatry.
Up to that time this had been their besetting sin, into which
they were ever falling. From the time of the captivity and
return onward to the present day the Jew has been a strict
monotheist. Though scattered to the ends of the earth, never
again has he fallen into this pit of iniquity and this slough of
despond. This is a most remarkable fact.</p>

<h3>Lesson 1</h3>

<h2>New Testament Division</h2>


<p><b>PRINCIPAL EVENTS</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Interval</b> between the Old and the New Testament&mdash;four hundred years of
silence. Governmentally, this period was divided between Persian,
Greek, Maccabean, and Roman rule.</p>

<p><b>Prelude</b> of angelic ministration. Message to Zacharias (Luke 1:5-20).
Annunciation to Mary (Luke 1:26-38). Angelic chorus on Bethlehem's
plains to shepherds (Luke 2:1-18). Warning to Joseph to flee from
Herod (Matt. 2:13). The first thirty years of the life of Jesus are
referred to but slightly in the Bible.</p>

<p><b>First Period.</b>&mdash;Six months of preaching by the "forerunner,"
John the Baptist (Matt. 3:1-13; also parallel passages).</p>

<p><b>Second Period.</b>&mdash;The entire life of Jesus, from the baptism
at Jordan to the crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.
(See entire Gospel narrative.)</p>

<p><b>Third Period.</b>&mdash;From Pentecost, the outpouring of the Spirit and
admission into the church of three thousand in one day (Acts 2:1-40).
Gentiles admitted to the church (Acts 10:1-48). The first persecution
(Acts 5:17-40). The martyrdom of Stephen (Acts 6, 7).</p>

<p><b>Fourth Period.</b>&mdash;The time of the Gentiles&mdash;the period in
which we now live (Rom. 11:25; Luke 21:24).</p>

<p><b>Fifth Period.</b>&mdash;Will begin with "the lifting of the veil"
from the eyes of Israel (2 Cor. 3:15, 16). The close of
this period will be a time of great blessing (Rom. 11:15).</p>

<p><b>The end</b> will witness the final triumph of the religion of the
Messiah over Jew and Gentile.</p></div>

<p><b>TIME.</b>&mdash;About 400 B. C. to present time.</p>

<p><b>PLACES.</b>&mdash;Palestine and Egypt; for the Third Period see
later maps.</p>

<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE OF EVENTS.</b>&mdash;The New Testament marks
the change from the old dispensation of priests as mediators,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>to the new, when "Jesus Christ became the propitiation for
our sins, and not for ours only, but for those of the whole
world!"</p>


<h4>The New Testament Preview</h4>

<p><b>103. Interval.</b>&mdash;Between the close of the Old Testament
Period and the opening of that of the New Testament there is
an interval of four centuries of silence.</p>

<p><b>104. Prelude.</b>&mdash;This is largely angelic in character. To
Zacharias comes the message of the birth of the forerunner.
Then follows the angelic annunciation to Mary herself. This in
turn is followed by the angelic message to the shepherds and
the heavenly chorus on Bethlehem's plain. Heaven stoops to
earth to announce its glad tidings. A new creation is heralded,
better and grander even than that of the opening chapters of
Genesis. One or two events are then recorded in the early life
of the Holy Child, and then there is silence for thirty years.
It is as though the prelude should end all. But no, the story
will not end with mere prelude. It will go on its course
till the very last act.</p>

<p><b>105. First Period.</b>&mdash;<i>From John to Jesus.</i> Suddenly John
the Baptist breaks on our vision, for his short but decisive part.
His message is twofold, and is comprised in the words "Repent,"
"Prepare." For six short months this fiery preacher calls the
nation to prepare for what God has in store for it. Multitudes
gather and hearken. Then comes Jesus from Nazareth, and
John almost in one breath calls him "Son of God" and "Lamb
of God." Two apparently irreconcilable titles, for the one
means power and exaltation, and the other sacrifice and humiliation.
How these two titles were to blend in one character will
be seen in the following acts of the Divine dealing with men.</p>

<p><b>106. Second Period.</b>&mdash;<i>From Jordan to the Mount of Olives.</i>
Three and a half years was this in duration. Short as compared
with any one of the Old Testament stories, but far more significant,
and more full of the Divine revelation of God's mercy and
justice. Now miracles multiply as never before, for now, as
never before, the Divine comes down to man and holds communion
with him. Now truth is made clear as no patriarch or prophet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
ever saw it. Truly in this period, "Great was the mystery of
godliness; he who was manifested in the flesh." With this period
we shall deal more in detail later on in these lessons, so we make
but brief allusion to it in this place. Suffice it to say that not
in all the history of this world were there ever three years and a
half so filled with benediction for mankind as were these of the
second period.</p>

<p><b>107. Third Period.</b>&mdash;<i>From Pentecost to the Turning to the Gentiles.</i>
Pentecost was the birthtime of the Christian Church. No Pentecost, no
Acts of the Apostles. No Acts of the Apostles, no Christian Church. In
that case the world of to-day would be heathen, Muhammadan and Jewish.
At Pentecost more were brought to an acceptance of Jesus as the
Messiah than Jesus himself had won in his whole active ministry. About
five hundred would seem to have been the number of believers after our
Lord's resurrection. Now in one day Peter wins and baptizes three
thousand. Thence onward the number of believers grows, till it numbers
thousands and thousands. But all these are yet Jews, or else
proselytes. The next step in this third period is the official opening
of the door to the Gentile world. This took place at C&aelig;sarea, and to
Peter was given the joy and privilege of admitting Gentiles without
their first becoming Jews. Through Pentecost and the experience at
C&aelig;sarea was in large measure fulfilled to Peter the "promise of the
keys" (Matt. 16:19), for he it was who received the Jews at Pentecost
into the church, and he too it was who opened the door of the church
to the Gentile world. How great this portion of Period Three, and how
significant to us, is apparent as soon as we realize that but for the
advance in C&aelig;sarea we in this day would first have to become Jews
before we could be members of the living church. Had the Jews been
willing to receive the Nazarene as their Messiah, there is no telling
what sweeping measure of blessing they might not have received.
Certain it is that their history from that day to this would have been
very different from what it has been. Their rulers cried, "We have no
king but C&aelig;sar," and from that time many of their people have had few
to rule over them but Czars, Sultans, Emperors, and hostile rulers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p><b>108. Fourth Period.</b>&mdash;<i>The Times of the Gentiles. In this
period we now are.</i> Here it behooves one to speak guardedly,
for opinions differ.  The writer gives his interpretation of
what the Word says. When the Jews refused to receive Jesus
as their Messiah, the Apostles plainly said, "We turn to the
Gentiles" (Acts 13:46). On account of their hardness of
heart, blindness came to Israel, and a veil fell before their eyes.
"A hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of
the Gentiles be come in" (Rom. 11:25). Our Lord alludes
to this same truth when he predicts that Jerusalem shall be
trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be
fulfilled (Luke 21:24). That Jerusalem from the days of Titus
to the present day has been thus trodden under foot of the
Gentile world is only too manifest to all who know its sad history.</p>

<p>In this period our lot is cast, and thus we become actors in the
great Divine drama of the New Testament. Solemn thought,
and one calculated to make us feel the serious nature of our
responsibility.</p>

<p><b>109. Fifth Period.</b>&mdash;This is yet to come. It will begin with
the "lifting of the veil" from the eyes of Israel. When that is
to begin we know not, and it is neither safe nor wise to venture
any guess. But that it will come in due time is as sure as that
all the other predictions of Old and New Testament have had
their commencement and their close. It will be a great day,
for, as the Apostle Paul says, "if the casting away of them
[Israel] is the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving
of them be, but life from the dead?" (Rom. 11:15). That
will be a day of vast ingathering into the kingdom of God, and
then Jesus shall see of the travail of his soul and be satisfied.</p>

<p><b>110. Then Comes the End.</b>&mdash;Jew and Gentile will then be
one, and the final triumph of the Redeemer will be ushered in.
Then the ransomed and redeemed of the Lord shall unite in
singing praises to him who has loved them and bought them,
and has brought them home to glory. (There are differences
of opinion as to the last two periods in this New Testament
story. Let the student go to the law and the testimony, as
referred to above, and decide for himself whether the writer is
upheld in his laying out of these two great periods.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE OF EVENTS.</b>&mdash;The fulfilment of prophecy is strikingly
shown in the events surrounding the coming of Christ and the
preparation for his ministry; and the preaching of John the Baptist
epitomized the message which Jesus was about to proclaim.</p>

<h4>The Incomparable Life</h4>

<p><b>111. The Thirty Years of Silence.</b>&mdash;To these years the
Gospels give small space. Only Matthew and Luke make any
mention of them, and these give to them only four chapters.
All the rest of the Gospels are devoted to the three and a half
years of the Lord's active ministry.</p>

<p><b>112.</b> Take, now, first what we <i>know</i> of this early life. It was lived
in Nazareth, in Galilee. Nazareth was a town where caravans rested on
their journeys between Damascus and Egypt. It was a rough town, as we
may infer by the remark of Nathanael, "Can any good thing come out of
Nazareth?" (John 1:46). His home was that of a workingman, as Joseph
was a carpenter. It was therefore the home of a poor man. Doubtless he
himself followed for all those years of silence, the trade of his
reputed father. So Jesus was truly a workingman himself. His mother
was exceptionally godly, as we see by her wonderful outburst of song
in Luke 1:46-55. This song is fairly saturated with the spirit of the
old prophets. Joseph also gives signs of his fear of the Lord during
these early years in more ways than one. Thus we may be sure that the
"atmosphere" of that home was conducive to godliness. He was taught
the Scriptures from his youth. This is apparent from his great
familiarity with them, shown in his later years. To this we shall
refer later.</p>

<p><b>113. His Early Education.</b>&mdash;Of course he was taught to read
and write, as every Jewish boy was. He also had the advantage
of frequent visits to Jerusalem, for the visit referred to by Luke,
at twelve years of age, was only the first of a long series of such
visits. No doubt after that first visit he went up to the Holy
City every year to the feast. A lad of his type of mind would
not let such an opportunity pass without taking advantage of
it each time that it came. So much we may say we practically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
know about these thirty years. But there is much that we may
legitimately <i>infer</i>, and when guardedly used, inference is a
legitimate source of knowledge. If you will let me go into a
man's library, I may be able to infer with much accuracy the
calling of that man. If the majority of the books are medical
or legal, I infer that the man is a doctor or a lawyer. If the
majority of the books that are worn are light fiction, my inference
is of a totally different nature. If, to change the illustration,
I go to the home of a lady, and in the afternoon find that I can
write my name in the dust on the polished piano-lid, I infer
somewhat about the housekeeper in whose home I am.</p>

<p><b>114.</b> Making, then, reverent use of inference, what may we
learn about these thirty years of our Lord's life, and of the
influences that were at work all that time? Who were his
teachers? For, bear in mind, that at the time of Jesus' entry
into his public ministry, he came as a full-fledged man, who was
prepared for his life's work.</p>

<p><b>115. Nature Taught Him.</b>&mdash;Nature is God's first book, and
if man had not sinned, he would have needed no other. To
Jesus, nature was an open volume, and he read it in all its
spiritual significance. While other boys saw only that which
was outward, he saw that which was inward and had spiritual
meaning. To him the lily spoke of his Father's care, the leaven
that he saw in his mother's house spoke to him of the way in
which the kingdom of God grew in this world. The mustard
seed was an illustration of the growth of truth. Many of his
most simple and precious teachings were drawn thus from nature.
Sparrows, seed and tares, fig-tree, salt, and many other objects
of nature told him of things unseen.</p>

<p><b>116. Men Taught Him.</b>&mdash;He doubtless mingled much with
them in Nazareth, and it is not hard to imagine the boy going to
the camping-place of the passing caravans, and listening to the
tales that the men from far countries had to tell. The stories
that he afterward made use of were in many cases doubtless
gathered from such sources. But he made them illustrate
things unseen and spiritual. Look at his parables, and see how
true this may easily be. The ten virgins may well have been a
story that he heard, and of which he made such solemn use in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
his ministry. Is it unnatural to suppose that in these gatherings
of men he may have heard some one tell of a pearl merchant
and his fortune in finding a peculiarly valuable pearl? In due
time he used this story to illustrate the wisdom of staking all
on one superlative venture. Look at his parables, and see how
he made use of the interests of men in making clear the things
pertaining to the kingdom of God. The sower, the lost silver,
the prodigal son, children in the market-place, the rich fool, the
vineyard and the laborers&mdash;these and many more show how
richly the relationships of men with their fellow-men instructed
him.</p>

<p><b>117. The Bible Taught Him.</b>&mdash;He was most familiar with its teachings,
and knew how to use them on the spot, without reference to commentary
or concordance. We find in his sayings reference to, or quotations
from, the following books of the Old Testament: Genesis, Exodus,
Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, 1 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 2
Chronicles, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel,
Jonah, Joel, Hosea, Micah, Zechariah, and Malachi&mdash;22 in all. Had all
the utterances of our Lord been given to us, I doubt not that we
should have found that he quoted from every book of the Old Testament.
For bear in mind that we have only a very small part of what our Lord
said preserved for us. His recorded words are only 38,422, or the
equivalent of ten short sermons. But for three years he was speaking
incessantly.</p>

<p><b>118. Prayer Taught Him.</b>&mdash;His habit of spending all night
in prayer was not one acquired of a sudden. No doubt he
spent many a night in prayer while he was still at the carpenter's
trade. But the prayer-habit is one calculated to shed much
light on things that lay hold on eternal truth. All spiritual
seers are men of much prayer.</p>

<p><b>119. Finally, His Visits to Jerusalem Taught Him.</b>&mdash;Not
in vain did he go at least 18 times to that city before his public
ministry began. It was in this way that he saw the formality
of the Pharisaic party, and the self-seeking of scribe and chief
priest. So when he denounced them so fiercely in later times,
he did it not out of an experience of day before yesterday, but
out of years of observation. Such were some of the influences<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
that surrounded him, and the teachers that prepared him during
those thirty years of silence for his great work. Thus, when
the fulness of time came, he stepped forth full armed for the
contest with the powers of darkness.</p>

<h4>The Incomparable Life (Continued)</h4>

<p><b>120. The Year of Obscurity.</b>&mdash;Before examining this at all, it will be
well to consider the state of national life into which the life of the
Master was projected. It was not like that which we have seen
prevailed so constantly before the captivity, for there was now among
Jews no idolatry of any kind to be found. This was a great gain.
Moreover, it was a national life under subjection to a foreign and
Gentile power. With this power the Lord had to reckon, of course. Once
more there was great reverence for the written Word, which was now
more full than it ever had been, for the Old Testament, as we have it,
was all in existence. There was to be found in every Jewish town the
synagogue, where the law was read and expounded. This institution was
an outgrowth of the captivity experience, and was most valuable. But,
alas! there was also much of formality, especially among the religious
leaders. They had so added to or explained the written law that it had
become void through the traditions of men. Much religiosity, but
little true religion, was to be found. Yet among the lowly there was
still true religion, as shown by such persons as Zacharias and
Elisabeth, Joseph and Mary, Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. Into a national
life such as is here very briefly indicated, Jesus came forth.</p>

<p><b>121. The Baptism.</b>&mdash;He is introduced to us in this year, first
at his baptism (Matt. 3:13). Here we have our first foreshadowing
of the Trinity, for here the Son stands, praying, while at the
same time the Father's approving voice is heard, and the Holy
Spirit descends and rests on the Son.</p>

<p><b>122. The Temptation.</b>&mdash;This is at once followed by the forty days of
temptation in the wilderness. Of this experience we are given but
three specific instances. These seem to be typical of all the rest,
and relate to: 1. Unlawful use of his miraculous power for himself. 2.
Dramatic display of his power as Messiah. 3. Absolute turning from his
life-purpose for the sake of self-aggrandizement. All these, it is
worthy of note, are resisted, by the use of the written Word, which in
Jesus' hands is a mighty sword. The fundamental reason for this
assault on the part of Satan may be found in the undoubted fact that
the Adversary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> knew that Jesus had come to this world to destroy his
works. Demons knew who Jesus was long before men did. On that account
the great assault was made, for if Jesus could be stumbled into sin,
then he could not be Saviour, since he himself would need to be saved.
Had Jesus yielded in the wilderness, Calvary would not have been of
any avail.</p>

<p><b>123. The First Disciples.</b>&mdash;During this first year Jesus gained
many disciples, though he himself did not, like John the Baptist,
baptize them. This he left to his chosen disciples. This shows
that the popularity of the Baptist had at this time already begun
to wane, as he himself predicted that it would. Not many
miracles are recorded during this period, though we know that
the one in Cana of Galilee was the first of a series.  The
gathering of disciples, who later became apostles, begins in
this year. In one day the record indicates that he gained six
of these (John 1:35-51).</p>

<p><b>124. The Cleansing of the Temple.</b>&mdash;A most dramatic event
in this year is his first cleansing of the Temple. The extortion
practised in the court of the Temple filled him with indignation
and he drove out the money changers, and dealers in cattle and
doves, declaring that his Father's house was a house of prayer,
while they had made it a den of thieves. This drew on him the
antagonism of the rulers under whose fostering care, or at least
through whose negligence, these abuses had grown up. This
antagonism never ceased until they had worked on him their
will on Calvary.</p>

<p><b>125. Interview with Nicodemus.</b>&mdash;It was during this first
year that we have two most remarkable dialogues of our Lord.
The first is that with the ruler Nicodemus. At this interview
either John the evangelist must have been present, or else Jesus
or Nicodemus must have told John what was said. In this dialogue
occurs the most significant sentence that the world has ever
heard, having within twenty-four words more of Divine truth
than any other similar number of words ever uttered,&mdash;John
3:16. In this verse, as Dr. Arthur T. Pierson puts it, we have
five couplets:</p>

<p>1. God the Father and the Son, as the originators of salvation.</p>

<p>2. The Divine action, "loved," and "gave."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Those toward whom this action was directed. "The
world," and to make it personal, "whosoever."</p>

<p>4. The condition on which the Divine gift may be had.
"Believe," and therefore "have."</p>

<p>5. That for which all this action is taken, "not perish," but
have "everlasting life."</p>

<p><b>126. The Woman of Samaria.</b>&mdash;In this year too, at its close,
comes the interview with the woman at Jacob's well, in Samaria.
It is well worth noticing that to a woman, and she a Samaritan
woman, Jesus poured out truth as prodigally as he did to Nicodemus,
a ruler of his own nation. The result of this interview
was the adherence of a large number of Samaritans to the
Master. All the above story of this first year of our Lord's
public ministry we learn only from the Gospel of John, each of
the other evangelists beginning his story with the Galilean
ministry.</p>

<p><b>127.</b> Note that our Lord's whole public life is condensed into
three and a half short years. Yet what a wonderful work he
accomplished in that period! The active life of Alexander the
Great was thirteen years, and that of Napoleon twenty-three
years. In those years these two men wrought wonders. But
their empire has long since passed away. The empire of the
Master is to-day wider than ever, and the work of those three
years and a half will never cease to be felt. This is because
he was more than mere man, and brought to his task super-human
power and knowledge.</p>


<h4>Test Questions</h4>

<p>State the condition of Palestine religiously at the time of
our Lord's entry into public life.</p>

<p>What was the value of the synagogue?</p>

<p>Give the first event of the year in question.</p>

<p>Of what doctrine do we see the foreshadowing at Christ's
baptism?</p>

<p>Give the threefold nature of the temptations of which we have
record.</p>

<p>What reason may we assign for the attempt of Satan to draw
Christ to sin?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>With whom did Jesus have a most significant interview in
Jerusalem?</p>

<p>Give the five couplets in John 3:16.</p>

<p>With whom did Jesus have another interview at Jacob's well?</p>

<p>What was the result of that interview?</p>

<p>What is there significant in the brevity of our Lord's public
life as compared with that of Alexander or Napoleon?</p>

<h4>The Incomparable Life (Continued)</h4>

<p><b>128. The Year of Popularity.</b>&mdash;This was spent in Galilee.
The Galileans had heard of his fame from those of their number
who had seen him in Jerusalem, so it required but a few deeds of
might to arouse them to the highest pitch of enthusiasm. His
activity during this year may be studied with relation, first, to
his miracles, and second, to his teaching.</p>

<p><b>129. His Miracles Multiplied.</b>&mdash;These were multiplied beyond
any previous precedent. They sprang from him as sparks spring
from the red-hot iron of the blacksmith under the hammer.
There must have been single days when he wrought hundreds of
miracles. Take that Sabbath day in Capernaum as an example.
In the morning in the synagogue he healed a demoniac. In the
later part of the day he healed Peter's mother-in-law. Then, as
the sun was setting, there came to him all in that city that had
maladies of any kind, and he healed them all. A wonderful day
that, for Capernaum. No wonder that later on he referred to
that city as exalted to heaven. His miraculous power manifested
itself over disease of every kind. No malady was unreachable
by him. The three characteristics of his healing ministry were,
first, it was instantaneous&mdash;there was no period of convalescence.
Deathly sick one moment&mdash;perfectly well the next; this was the
history of each patient. (One exception there is to this, and
that is of the man who needed two touches to cure his blindness
(Mark 8:24.) Was the man's faith at fault?) Second, it was
perfect&mdash;there were no signs of weakness left and no relapses.
How unlike the frequent experience under even the best of
modern physicians! In the third place, it was all <i>without money
or price</i>.</p>

<p><b>130. His Power</b> was equally great over death. He called, and Lazarus
came forth; he took the dead maiden by the hand and she arose. He
spoke to the young man on his bier and he responded. His power
extended to the spirit world, for he commanded evil spirits to come
out of men, and they obeyed. Nature obeyed his voice, as when he spoke
to the winds and the waves and they were hushed. Man, nature, and the
spirit world all recognized his power and yielded swift obedience. No
wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> that his popularity was immense under these circumstances. It
would not be possible to exaggerate the exciting scenes through which
he passed during this year. Men thronged around him so violently, and
crushed together to see and hear him so vehemently, that many were
thrown down and trampled on. Wild cries must have come from the masses
of people who so excitedly pressed near to him. They actually broke up
the roof of one house so as to get into his presence the patient for
whom they craved his services. He had not time so much as to eat in
peace, as they gave him no respite (Mark 6:31).</p>

<p><b>131. His Miracles as Lessons.</b>&mdash;All these miracles of his were
in reality also object-lessons to lead men to an apprehension of
things invisible and spiritual. If he healed a man born blind,
it was to make men see that they needed spiritual sight. If he
touched the deaf man's ears and made him hear, what was this
but an object-lesson showing that they woefully needed spiritual
hearing? And if he raised the dead, this, too, was to teach a
great spiritual truth, namely, that he was the resurrection and
the life.</p>

<p><b>132.</b> In all this wonderful life we are glad to note how much
of happiness must have come to the Master as he saw the sick
made instantly well. At the same time his gift of healing sometimes
brought to him exquisite sorrow, as in the case of the ten
lepers, nine of whom did not think it worth their while to go back
to say, "Thank you." It was at this time in his ministry that
the Master began to bid men whom he helped hold their peace,
for there was really danger that the excited throngs would
develop into uncontrollable mobs, and that the Roman government
would find it necessary to interfere.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p><p><b>133. His Teaching</b> was apparently less important than were his
miracles, though it was really more important. If we could have only
the miracles, or the teaching, we would at once take the teaching. The
miracles were chiefly temporary in their effect, while the influence
of the teaching is eternal. In view of the fact that, as noted in
<a href="#Page_76">Lesson 2</a>, we have so few of his words recorded, we may well wonder at
their power. As he said, "the words that I have spoken unto you are
spirit, and are life" (John 6:63).</p>

<p><b>134.</b> His teaching was characterized by its <b>boldness</b>. He
taught them as one who had authority, for he knew by inward
experience the truth of all that he uttered. The Scribes were
more like parrots, for they repeated the opinions of those who had
gone before them, and had no true vision of things spiritual.
Jesus, on the other hand, did not hesitate to quote passages from
Moses, and set them aside, on his own authority. He had larger
vision than had the great lawgiver, and he was well aware of
that fact. "Ye have heard that it hath been said&mdash;but I say
unto you," such was his confident manner of teaching. And the
results of his teaching have fully substantiated his claim.</p>

<p><b>135.</b> In his teaching he was <b>infinitely tender</b> with confessed
sin, but at the same time he was equally stern against professed
holiness. No more terrible words have ever been spoken than
those of the Master against the Scribes and Pharisees, on account
of their hypocrisy. To read them with any adequate conception
of the occasion is to feel almost terrified at their vehemence.
On the other hand, no zephyr was ever more gentle than were
his words to those who felt their sin and wished to abandon it.</p>

<p><b>136.</b> In his teaching he <b>made much use of parable</b>, for this
was in reality a picture, and he knew that pictures convey truth
and are remembered longer than any other form of speech.
What an array of pictures his parables have hung in the galleries
of our memories! Prodigal Son, Good Samaritan, Ten Virgins,
Lost Sheep, Unjust Judge&mdash;what are these but pictures that
we cherish, and from which we gain eternal truths of the most
precious nature?</p>

<p><b>137.</b> His teaching for the most part revolved around the idea
of <b>the Kingdom of God on Earth, and Himself as its Center</b>.
Let the student look up all the parables of the Kingdom and he
will realize the truth of this statement. The reason why even
his nearest disciples misunderstood him so, and thought that this
kingdom was to be like that of David, was that they did not put
the emphasis in the right place. They thought of "The <i>kingdom</i>
of God," while he thought of "The Kingdom of <i>God</i>." There is
a great difference between these two forms of emphasis. The
one led them to ask for places on his right and left in his kingdom;
the other emphasized the truth that the Kingdom of God is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
within you. Thus in the midst of great excitement, this year of
popularity was spent. Tours through Galilee were like triumphal
processions, and the throngs were never weary of crowding on
him and the disciples. Alas! that the people should not have
better appreciated the inwardness of his mission, but should
have taken in only that which was temporal and not eternal!</p>

<h4>The Incomparable Life (Continued)</h4>

<p><b>138. The Year of Opposition.</b>&mdash;Our Lord's year of popularity waned much
after the miracle of the feeding of the five thousand. This miracle
stirred the people to the very height of enthusiasm. Now, they
thought, we have one who is worthy to be our king. So intense was this
conviction that they wanted on the spot to proclaim him king, and
raise the standard of revolt against Rome (John 6:15). Even the
disciples seem to have been infected with this mad thought, for he
"constrained" them to go away (Matt. 14:22). On the day following,
however, the multitudes found him again, and tried to persuade him to
repeat the miracle of feeding. This he refused to do. He tried to make
them understand that he had better bread for them, even the bread of
life. But what they really wanted was only bakers' bread. They thought
that if Moses fed the people for forty years for nothing, their
Messiah should do even better than that. So, when he refused to be to
them a "commissariat department," they at once forsook him. "Many" of
his disciples "went back" at that time. For all of this read John
6:22-71. At this moment it was that Peter comes so grandly to the
front and makes his confession. When we see Peter later on denying his
Master, let us bear in mind his bold stand taken at this juncture.</p>

<p><b>139. Opposed by the Pharisees.</b>&mdash;During all this year of
popularity the Pharisees were dogging the footsteps of the
Master, as spies dog the criminal. Of these Pharisees there were
at this time, in Palestine, about 6000. They were the ecclesiastical
leaders of the people, and this makes their opposition all
the more ghastly. They, who should have led the people aright,
led them astray. The grounds of their opposition were manifold.
Among others were the following:</p>

<p>(1) They opposed him because of their <i>own intense pride</i>.
They were those who sought glory one of another, and so they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
could not believe in him (John 5:44). His aims and theirs were
so widely apart that they could not even understand him. To
them the glory that cometh from God had no attractiveness.
So they opposed him who was meek and lowly.</p>

<p>(2) They opposed him on account of <i>his humble origin</i>. He
was only a carpenter's son, and so to them was of no account.
Had they made due investigation, they would have found that
he came of the line of David, their great king. But they did
nothing of the sort (Matt. 13:55-58). It was an offense to
them that he came from among the lowly, and not from some
of the aristocratic families of the land. His lack of training in
the schools seems to have nettled them, so that they exclaimed in
disgusted surprise, "How knoweth this man letters, having
never learned?" (John 7:15.)</p>

<p>(3) They opposed him bitterly, on account of <i>the company that he
kept</i>. In contempt they said, "This man receiveth sinners, and eateth
with them" (Luke 15:2). And they continually complained that he was a
friend of hated publicans and sinners. They could not understand at
all that the very grandeur of his mission consisted just in this, that
he came to call sinners to repentance. Their complaint, as given in
Luke 15:2, called forth from him three of the grandest parables that
we have, namely, those of the lost silver, the lost sheep, and the
lost son. Especially were they angered because he had taken into the
number of his disciples the hated Matthew, the tax-gatherer.</p>

<p>(4) They opposed him again because of his <i>failure to observe
the Sabbath</i> in the manner prescribed by themselves. They had
made the day one of weariness to the flesh, and had passed by
deeds of mercy and helpfulness. So when he healed the man at
the Pool of Bethesda and the man born blind, on the Sabbath,
they took counsel how they might destroy him. While they
themselves would pull out a sheep or an ox from the pit on the
Sabbath, they criticized him for healing men on that day. This
brought forth from him stern condemnation, which, of course,
did not mollify their feelings toward him.</p>

<p>(5) Furthermore, they opposed him because he <i>declined to observe</i>
certain minute regulations of the law concerning washing of hands and
the like. These regulations they had laid on men's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> shoulders, but
they were not at all Divine ordinances. This is why he said, in his
denunciation of them, "they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be
borne, and lay them on men's shoulders, but they themselves will not
move them with their finger" (Matt. 23:4). (Read the whole of Matt.
23, and you will understand better who and what these men were who
were opposing the Master.) Once more, they opposed him because he had
made such friends of the common people and had not in any way bowed
down to them, as the leaders of the people. The common people heard
him gladly, and that angered them. "This multitude who knoweth not the
law are cursed" (John 7:49). They were furious because the whole world
seemed to have gone after him, while they themselves were left in the
background. This was galling to their innate pride.</p>

<p>(6) What made their opposition all the worse was that though they
could not deny his miracles, they went so far as to ascribe them to
the agency of Satan. "He hath a demon, and is mad: why hear ye him?"
is what they exclaimed (John 10:20). The Pharisees said, "By the
prince of the demons casteth he out demons" (Matt. 9:34). So they
dared to ascribe to demoniac possession the deeds of him in whom the
Spirit dwelt without measure. It was this ascribing to the spirit of
darkness of the works of the Holy Spirit that brought forth from the
Master his statement concerning the unpardonable sin. It really
consisted in ascribing to the Holy Spirit the works of the prince of
darkness.</p>

<p><b>140. Away from the Crowds.</b>&mdash;After the miracle of the
feeding of the five thousand, the Master was mostly in out of the
way places, such as C&aelig;sarea Philippi, Decapolis, and the coasts
of Tyre and Sidon. He feared lest the Galileans, if he wrought
more miracles among them, would raise insurrection, and so
bring on him the power of the Roman government. This would
have ruined his mission to this earth. For about six months
after the miracle of the five thousand he tarried in Galilee and
its immediate vicinity before he started on his final journey to
Jerusalem. It was during these six months that the transfiguration
took place.</p>

<h4>The Incomparable Life (Continued)</h4>

<p><b>141. The Passion Week.</b>&mdash;Our Lord arrived at Bethany on his
last journey to Jerusalem on Friday before the Passover. On
the following Sunday came the triumphal entry into Jerusalem.
Reckoning from that day to the day of his resurrection, we have
eight days. How important these days were in the minds of
the evangelists may be seen from the amount of space they give
to the narrative of these days. To the three years and more of
his public ministry, the four evangelists give in all 55 chapters.
But to the eight days spoken of, they give 30 chapters. It is
most significant that had they told the story of his public ministry
in as great detail, it would have occupied over 4000 chapters.
This may be seen in part in the accompanying chart.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 70%;">
<img src="images/illus-102.png" width="100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><b>142.</b> <i>Bear in mind</i> that the ecclesiastics had by this time
determined on his death. But they did not want that to take
place on the feast day, lest there should be an uproar among the
people, who believed on him. That is, they were afraid of a
rescue (Matt. 26:5). Yet it did come on the feast day. The
reasons for this are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) His triumphal entry. The jubilation among the people
angered them. They perceived that the people welcomed him,
and that they prevailed against him not at all. Of course this
was stinging to their pride, and they feared the outcome of this
popular enthusiasm.</p>

<p>(2) They were further angered by their failure to discomfit
him in argument in the very presence of the multitude. Their
effort to entangle him in his talk, as shown in Matthew 22:15-46,
was a total failure, and they knew that the people rejoiced at
their discomfiture. This was most galling to their pride as
religious leaders of the nation. Add to this the terrific denunciation
that Jesus poured forth on them, as told in Matthew 23:1-39,
and bear in mind that this was in the presence of all the people,
and you have an explanation of the resentment on their part.</p>

<p>(3) Just about at this juncture Judas came with his offer,
which to them must have seemed most timely. He knew where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
he could find the Master when the people would be absent, and
they relied on their influence with Pilate to carry their scheme
through swiftly, so that there would be no chance of any rescue.
So, with this combination of circumstances, they determined to
go ahead in spite of the fact of the approaching Passover.</p>

<p><b>143. The Trial.</b>&mdash;This was twofold. In the first place, it was an
ecclesiastical trial. It was before Annas (informal), then before
Caiaphas, and the Sanhedrin. Here the charges were all ecclesiastical.
They were that he had spoken against the temple; that he had broken
the Sabbath, and that he was guilty of blasphemy in calling himself
the Son of God. These charges they could not prove, but that made no
difference, for the issue was already determined in their minds. So
they condemned him to death. But they had no power under the Roman
government to inflict the death penalty. So they had to take him
before the Roman Governor. This brings us to the second trial. This
was political. Here the charges were entirely different from those on
which they had condemned him to death. Now they charged him with
forbidding to pay taxes, and with setting himself up to be a king, in
rivalry with C&aelig;sar. All this was false, and they knew it, but they
cared nothing for that, so long as they could persuade Pilate to give
them the desired verdict. Pilate repeatedly declared him innocent, as
did also Herod, to whom Pilate sent him. But the ecclesiastics would
take nothing but his death as their right. So at last Pilate weakly
yielded, and gave sentence as they desired.</p>

<p><b>144. The scene at the cross</b> surpasses all description. Note
who were there. Gentiles were there in the form of Roman
soldiers. Jews were there in the persons of the ecclesiastics,
who reviled on the cross him who for so long had gone about
doing good. Even at this time they bore witness to his power,
crying out, "He saved others; himself he cannot save." Had
they put it, "He saved others, himself he <i>will not</i> save," they
would have been strictly within the truth. For he could have
saved himself, since it lay within his power to call for twelve
legions of angels, and they would have responded at once. Then
where would the chief priests or even the Roman soldiers have
been?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p><b>145.</b> There, too, were <i>the Apostles</i>, who were filled with despair
at the fate of him who they had hoped would redeem Israel.
Now their hope perished, and they gave way to dark despair.
All his acquaintances from Galilee were there, the women beating
their breasts for sorrow. Criminals were there as his companions
in agony and shame. Yes, the scene at the cross was the most
dramatic that the world had ever seen. For the time, the
powers of darkness seem to have triumphed, and the best man
in the world was nailed to the accursed cross.</p>

<p><b>146. The Penitent Robber.</b>&mdash;Yet even here a sudden ray of
light divine breaks the darkness, and in the penitent robber we
have the most wonderful record of the triumph of faith that the
world has ever seen. How he was led out into the light of faith
just at the moment that the faith of all others was eclipsed we
cannot tell, but the fact remains. Note, all, even the Apostles,
had given up faith in Jesus as the Messiah. But just at this
moment, like the sun bursting through the dark thunder-cloud,
we see the faith of this robber emerge, resplendent, for he
recognized in the crucified man next him his "Lord." He also
recognizes in him a king, for he speaks to him concerning his
kingdom, to which he is about to go. More than this. The
robber believes that it will be well with him in the next world if
his dying companion in pain remembers him, and he also believes
that he will be willing to remember him. What a most wonderful
exhibition of faith this was, under the circumstances. At
the moment when the powers of darkness were most triumphant
the power of the Holy Spirit was also most clearly shown. And
in response to all this faith comes the reassuring reply, "To-day
shalt thou be with me in Paradise."</p>

<p><b>147.</b> At the cross, too, we may see the epitome of all men in
their relation to sin and death, for while all three of the victims
that day were brought to the cross by sin, they stood in very
different relationships to sin. See, all died because of sin. But
the impenitent robber died <i>in</i> his sin. On the other hand, the
penitent robber that day died <i>to</i> sin. Jesus could do neither of
these things, for he had no sin. But that day he died <i>for</i> sin.
This truth is set forth in the accompanying diagram, and is
most suggestive. None but Jesus can die for sin, but all sinners
must either die in sin or die to sin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p><b>TIME.</b>&mdash;A. D. 30.</p>

<p><b>PLACES.</b>&mdash;Jerusalem, Galilee, Mt. of Olives.</p>


<h4>The Incomparable Life (Concluded)</h4>

<p><b>148. The Forty Days.</b>&mdash;As it is unfortunately customary on
the part of certain modern critics to deny the physical resurrection
of our Lord, and to maintain that all that we know about
him after his resurrection is that he was alive, it seems needful
to give a whole lesson to these forty days. The critics above
referred to claim that the disciples of Jesus <i>expected</i> his physical
resurrection, and, being ignorant and unlearned, they were easily
deceived by the reports of the women. In reply to this unwarranted
claim the following truths must be insisted on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p><b>149.</b> <i>First truth.</i> The disciples never expected Jesus <i>to die</i>, least
of all on the cross. Indeed, the general expectation was that the
Messiah must abide forever (John 12:34). So when he spoke of his
death, they did not even understand what he meant. (See Mark 9:32;
Luke 9:45; Luke 18:34.) At one time when Jesus spoke of all this,
Peter even ventured to rebuke him (Matt. 16:22).</p>

<p><b>150.</b> <i>Second truth.</i> From the above it is most apparent that they
never <i>even thought</i> of a resurrection (see Mark 9:10). When they saw
him die, and knew from the physical signs of the blood and water that
he was dead, they at once gave up all hope in him as the expected
Messiah. This is apparent from the remark of the two to the Master as
they were going to Emmaus (Luke 24:21). Their remark implies that now
they had given up any such hope. But more than this. Had they thought
of any resurrection, would they not have remained near the garden
where his body was laid? Surely John and the Master's mother would not
have abandoned that garden for Jerusalem. Nor would they have prepared
spices for his final entombment had they had any reasonable hope of
his resurrection. What took the women to the tomb on that Easter
morning was not any remotest hope that they might find him alive, but
only the completion of plans for his final burial. All this is
apparent from the unvarnished narrative of all of the evangelists.
Rightly read, the narrative reveals the one fact that they had not the
least hope that they would ever see him alive in this world.</p>

<p><b>151.</b> <i>Third truth.</i> When the tomb was found empty on that
Easter morning, even that did not awaken any thought that the
Lord had risen. This is proved by the whole story of Mary on
that day (John 20). All her thought was, where is <i>the body</i>?
Even when Jesus appeared to Mary, she did not recognize him
at first, so far was it from her thought that he could be living.
And when the women reported to the disciples that they had seen
him alive, their words seemed to the Apostles as "idle talk"
(Luke 24:11). So when Peter and John ran to the tomb and
found not his body, they simply believed that it had been taken
away by some one, and not at all that he had risen from the dead,
for as yet they knew not the truth that he must rise (John 20:9).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p><b>152.</b> <i>Fourth truth.</i> When the women were convinced that
the Lord was really risen, still the men remained unconvinced.
The two on their way to Emmaus did not recognize him, for
they never thought that it could be he. Peter seems to have
been convinced when the Lord appeared to him, but in that upper
chamber, when they all (excepting Thomas) saw him, still they
would not believe that it was really he, but thought that they
saw a spirit (Luke 24:36-40). It took physical demonstration
to prove to these men that he was really in their presence. No,
they were not the "credulous" men that the critics would have
us believe.</p>

<p><b>153.</b> <i>Fifth truth.</i> But as yet Thomas would not believe, and
a whole week of arguing on the part of the other disciples did not
move him. It took the personal appearance of the Master
himself to convince Thomas that the others had not been deceived
(John 20:24-29). All this is proof positive that the critics are
wrong in this matter and that the evangelists are telling the
simple truth about the physical resurrection of our blessed Lord.</p>

<p><b>154.</b> <i>Sixth truth.</i> If the body had not risen, but was still in
the grave, it would have been easy for the Jews to disprove the
story of the physical resurrection. All they would have had to do
was to say, "Here we have the body, and to talk of resurrection
under these circumstances is absurd." The concocted falsehood
(Matt. 28:11-15) shows that the body was not in the grave.
But for the disciples to steal it while the Roman soldiers were
on guard was absolutely impossible. This is why money had to
be given to the soldiers, and they made sure that Pilate would
be "fixed" also, and so the soldiers be saved from punishment.</p>

<p><b>155. The Conclusion.</b>&mdash;No, the arguments offered to convince
us that Jesus' body did not rise are all based on unbelief, and
buttressed by false presentation of the whole case. To all these
we simply respond, "Now IS Christ risen from the dead."</p>

<p>The appearances of the Master, given in their order, so far as
we can arrange it, are as follows:</p>

<p>1. To Mary at the tomb (John 20:11-18).</p>

<p>2. To the women as they were returning from the empty
tomb (Matt. 28:9).</p>

<p>3. To Peter (Luke 24:34).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>4. To the two walking to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-33).</p>

<p>5. To the ten in the upper chamber (Luke 24:36-48).</p>

<p>6. To the eleven in the upper chamber (John 20:26-29).</p>

<p>7. To James (1 Cor. 15:7).</p>

<p>8. To the seven, at the Sea of Galilee (John 21:1-25).</p>

<p>9. To the five hundred brethren in a mountain in Galilee
(1 Cor. 15:6).</p>

<p>10. To the Apostles in Jerusalem (Acts 1).</p>

<p>To these may be added his appearances to Paul, to Stephen,
and to John on the Isle of Patmos.</p>

<p><b>156. The Ascension.</b>&mdash;At last we come to the final scene.
We are on the Mount of Olives. He is there, and with him the
eleven. As he blesses them, lo, he begins to ascend. In rapt
amazement they gaze on his disappearing figure. Then a cloud
intervenes, and he is lost to their sight. Still they gaze, hoping
once more to see him, when they are aware that two strangers
are with them. These men say to them that this same Jesus will
return again in like manner as they have just seen him go. Satisfied
with this message, they return to Jerusalem, there to tarry
until they be endued with that power of which the Master had
just spoken to them. How this power came and the results of
its coming we shall see in the lesson on the Acts of the Apostles.</p>

<h4>Development of the Early Church</h4>

<p><b>157. Importance of the Book.</b>&mdash;The Acts of the Apostles is
the most important book in the New Testament, for if we were
to lose one of the Gospels, we should still have three left, and if
we lost one epistle, the others would still be ours. But if we had
no "Acts," we should be left with no story of the ascension,
(except Luke 24:51) and the next record would be Paul's letter
to the Thessalonians. The whole story of Pentecost, and the
spread of the Gospel, would be lacking, and, indeed, we should
know nothing of the writer of the above-named epistle, nor how
he came to write to the church in Thessalonica. We should have
absolutely nothing to bridge over the gap between the ascension
and this letter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 70%;">
<img src="images/illus-111.png" width="100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p><b>158.</b> In the Acts there are six pivotal events, on which all the
rest of the story turns. Master these, and the whole story is
clear. These events we give as follows:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Pentecost.</i> This means power. It is suggestive that the
Greek word translated power (Acts 1:8) is the one from which
our word dynamite comes. Bear in mind the situation at the
ascension. Here were fishermen and common individuals, to
whom was committed the carrying of the gospel to all the world,
yet they had neither education, nor wealth, nor social position,
nor political influence. What an impossible task! What they
needed, therefore, more than anything else, was power from above.
It was this that Pentecost gave them, and that, too, in such
measure that Peter won, in one day, more disciples for his Master
than the Master himself had won in three and a half years.
Thus the church was founded, and before long numbered in
Jerusalem over ten thousand persons.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Persecution.</i> At first persecution might seem to be a
disaster to the church. As a matter of fact, it was a great blessing.
There was danger that the believers in Jerusalem would forget
that they were told to "begin" at Jerusalem, but were to go to
Judea and Samaria, and as far as the ends of the earth. Up to
the time of the persecution that arose about Stephen there is
no sign that the church did anything outside of the City of David.
So, in the providence of God, the cloud of persecution broke on
them and they were scattered abroad. Most fortunate it is
that then they did their duty, for we read that the disciples
(except the Apostles who stayed in Jerusalem), went everywhere
"preaching the Word" (Acts 8:1-4). This event marked the
beginning of that spread of the gospel that has never ceased from
that day to this, and never will cease, until the final victory is
won. Through persecution it was that God stirred up the
disciples, and forced them to do work that they seem, in their
great joy over the truth, to have neglected.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The conversion of Saul.</i> By far the most dangerous enemy of the
infant church was Saul of Tarsus. How he worked, and how the church
feared him, we shall see more in detail in our next lesson. Suffice it
to say here that had he continued in his first course, the whole
history of the spread of the Gospel would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> been very different
from what it was. From the standpoint of the truth of God, next to
Moses, Paul was the greatest man who has ever lived. To have him on
the side of the truth, instead of against it, was a great thing for
the church of that day and for the church since that day. That which
is of the utmost importance in the conversion of Saul is the fact that
Jesus himself appeared to him, and in this way gave him, as it were,
the Master's own sanction to act as one of the Apostles. As a matter
of fact, the two most important miracles of the New Testament are the
resurrection of the Lord and the conversion of Saul of Tarsus.</p>

<p>(4) <i>The tearing down of the middle wall of partition.</i> This took
place in C&aelig;sarea, and to Peter was given the great privilege of
tearing this wall down. What was this wall? (Eph. 2:14.) It was one
divinely built centuries before. Up to the experience at C&aelig;sarea (Acts
10) no Gentile might come into the church of God, excepting by way of
the Gate of the Proselyte. He must submit to Jewish ordinances and
customs before he could be one of the Covenant People. The Apostles
themselves had no thought that the Gentiles ever could come into the
church excepting in the usual way. Without circumcision, they believed
no man could be acceptable to God. Now the time had come when this
"middle wall" must come down, and to Peter was given the high
privilege of accomplishing this task. But to convince Peter that the
command was of Divine origin, it was needful for God to perform a
double miracle, the like of which had never been seen. Therefore to
Peter on the housetop at Joppa, and to Cornelius the centurion, in
C&aelig;sarea, God gave a vision, and when the two visions were brought
together, they were found to match exactly. Then when the Holy Spirit
came to the men at Cornelius' house, Peter was convinced that the
middle wall was down, and that to the Gentiles as well as to the Jews
the door was open on condition of faith in the Messiah. In this event
and that of the church on the day of Pentecost, when Peter opened the
door of the church to 3000 Jews, we see, in part at least (and in
large part), the fulfilment of "the power of the keys" (Matt. 16:19).
To exaggerate the importance of this breaking down of the middle wall
is not possible, for had not that been done, we in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> this day would
still have to become Jews before we could be members of God's church
on earth. This action by Peter was afterward endorsed by the Council
at Jerusalem (Acts 15:1-31), at which the apostle rehearsed his
experiences in Caesarea.</p>

<p>(5) <i>The organizing of missionary work by the church.</i> This
was done in Antioch, as seen in Acts 13:1-3. In this action,
guided by the Holy Spirit, the church at Antioch became the
pioneer church in missionary labor. It is worth noting that the
Holy Spirit chose for this missionary work, not the inferior
members of the church, but their very best men. What an
example to the church of later days! To this day we need not
the lesser lights for missionary work, but the great lights of the
church. Let the lesser lights burn at home, but the great lights
be sent into the outer darkness to illuminate that. This is the
Divine plan.</p>

<p>(6) <i>The crossing of the gospel from Asia to Europe.</i> This took place
from Troas to Philippi. It was in accord with the Divine plan (Acts
16:9). This army of invasion consisted of only four men, Paul, Silas,
Timothy, and Luke. A feeble force, as viewed from the merely human
standpoint; but a potent force viewed from the Divine position. The
story is one of the most fascinating in all history. Noteworthy it is
that in Europe the first two converts were women&mdash;Lydia was the first,
and the poor woman possessed of a spirit of divination the second
(Acts 16). This woman was under the control of a syndicate of men, who
made gain from her misfortune. In these two cases we see a kind of
prophecy of the work that the gospel does for womankind. All other
religions degrade woman. Only the Christian religion puts her where
God originally placed her, by man's side, as his helpmate.</p>

<p>Alas! soon half of this army of invasion finds itself in prison
on account of its beneficent work. Yet even here they make a
conquest, and before morning the jailor, who put them in the
inner prison, is himself a prisoner of the Lord Jesus Christ. An
army with such a spirit as Paul and Silas had is practically
invincible. Thus, the gospel started on its westward way,
destined in due time to reach these western shores, then as yet
unknown to the eastern world.</p>

<h3>Lesson 9</h3>

<h2>The Life of Paul</h2>

<h5>New Testament Division&mdash;Third Period (Concluded)</h5>


<p><b>PRINCIPAL EVENTS</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>His Early Life.</b>&mdash;Born (as Saul) at Tarsus, in Cilicia (Acts
22:3), the date of his birth not being known. His trade
was that of tentmaking (Acts 18:3), and this he found
useful later (1 Cor. 4:12). He was educated under Gamaliel,
a noted Rabbi (Acts 22:3; 5:34).</p>

<p><b>His First Appearance</b> in the gospel story is at the stoning of
Stephen (Acts 8:3) and he became an active persecutor of
Christians (Acts 9:1; 26:10, 11; 9:13).</p>

<p><b>His Conversion</b> took place on the road to Damascus (Acts
9:1-22; 22:3-13; 26:9-18). He went to Arabia (Gal.
1:15-17) and worked in Syria and Cilicia (Gal. 1:21). He
was brought by Barnabas to Antioch (Acts 11:25, 26) and
remained there a year.</p>

<p><b>His First Missionary Journey</b> began at Antioch (Acts 13:1-3) and is
described in Acts 13 to Acts 15:35, when a return to Antioch was made.
He was stoned at Lystra (Acts 14:8-19) and made a number of disciples
(Acts 14:20-24).</p>

<p><b>His Second Missionary Journey</b> began at Antioch, where he and Barnabas
disagreed (Acts 15:36-40) and is recorded in Acts 15 to 18:22. Timothy
joined him (Acts 16:1-3), he heard the call of need from Macedonia;
crossing to Europe (Acts 16:8-10) he planted churches (Acts 17:1-9;
18:1-17) and again returned to Antioch.</p>

<p><b>His Third Missionary Journey</b> began at Antioch, and is
recorded in Acts 18:23 to Acts 21:26. It included a stay
of three months in Greece, and ended at Jerusalem, where
he made a report of his Gentile ministry (Acts 21:15-26).</p>

<p><b>His Voyage to Rome</b> began with arrest in Jerusalem (Acts 21:27-36). A
plot to kill Paul failed (Acts 23:12-14). <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>He was sent to C&aelig;sarea and
appeared before the Roman rulers (Acts 24, 25, 26), remaining there
over two years (Acts 24:27). He suffered shipwreck (Acts 27:1-44), but
reached Rome at last (Acts 28:1-31).</p>

<p><b>His Sufferings</b> are outlined in 2 Corinthians 11:25-28.</p></div>

<p><b>TIME.</b>&mdash;About A. D. 2 to A. D. 63.</p>

<p><b>PLACES.</b>&mdash;Tarsus, Jerusalem, Arabia, Damascus, Antioch,
Cyprus, Perga, Antioch in Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe,
Malta, Galatia, Troas, Corinth, Athens, Caesarea, Rome.
(Details of <a href="#Page_266">Paul's journeys</a> are given in the <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>.)</p>

<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE OF EVENTS.</b>&mdash;Paul bequeathed to his Christian
posterity the record of a life unreservedly consecrated
to service and a series of letters which set forth the philosophy
of Christian belief in a manner that for simplicity and depth
has never been surpassed.</p>


<h4>Paul&mdash;Persecutor and Preacher</h4>

<p><b>159. His Birthplace.</b>&mdash;Saul was born in Tarsus in Cilicia,
which was one of the university cities of that day. Unlike John
the Baptist, therefore, Saul was a city-bred man, and this urban
influence is seen in the illustrations of truth that he loves to use.
They deal largely with city life. The influence, too, of a city is
apparent in his mental make-up, for no one like Saul could be
brought up in a university town without feeling the influence of
his environment.</p>

<p><b>160. His Age.</b>&mdash;Exactly when he was born is not known.
But all seem to agree that it was about the same time as our Lord,
so that when Jesus was playing in the streets of Nazareth, Saul
may have been playing in the streets of Tarsus. His parents
evidently intended that he should be a rabbi, but before he went
to Jerusalem, there to continue his studies, they had him learn
the trade of a tentmaker (Acts 18:3). This trade was most
useful to him in later days (1 Cor. 4:12). In Jerusalem he was
under the instruction of a noted teacher named Gamaliel,
(Acts 5:34), and Saul names him as his teacher in Acts 22:3.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 70%;">
<img src="images/illus-118.png" width="100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><b>161. He comes before us first</b> in the stoning of Stephen, where he
cares for the garments of those who did the actual stoning of the
first martyr. Then for a while he stands to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
forefront in the bitter persecution of the new and hated sect of the Nazarene. For the
fearful work that he did in Jerusalem read Acts 8:3, and Acts 9:1; for
similar work done elsewhere also Acts 26:10, 11. How widely he was
soon known as a ruthless persecutor we learn from Acts 9:13. On
account of all this he was the most feared man in the world by all
believers.</p>

<p><b>162. His miraculous conversion</b> took place on the way to Damascus on an
errand of persecution. Of this we have one narrative given by Luke,
and two given by the Apostle himself. (Acts 9:1-22; Acts 22:3-13; Acts
26:9-18). From the moment of his conversion, Saul was a changed man.
That which he hated before he now loved, and for the sake of his newly
found Master he was willing to suffer all the persecutions that he
himself had up to that time meted out to others. As a consequence of
his preaching in Damascus he was obliged to flee, and he went at once
to Arabia (Gal. 1:15-17), where many think that he spent three years
in the vicinity of Mount Sinai, where Moses and Elijah had learned so
much. It may be also that before he comes to the front in the story
told by Luke, he was in Syria and Cilicia, as mentioned in Galatians
1:21.</p>

<p><b>163. In connection with the revival in Antioch</b>, he is introduced by
Barnabas, who went to Tarsus and got him to aid him in his work (Acts
11:25, 26). Here the Apostle remained for about one year, doing grand
work for the church in that place. As we have seen in our lesson on
the Acts, this was the church which organized the first missionary
work, and sent Paul and Barnabas as their missionaries to other
cities. Here begins <b>Paul's first missionary journey</b> (Acts 13:2). In
all his work Paul aimed at cities, for he knew that there he could
find men, and these were what he sought. This first journey took him
to Cyprus, Perga, Antioch in Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe, and back
through Lystra, Iconium, Antioch, to Attalia, and back to Antioch in
Syria. Let the scholar read the story as told in Acts 13 and 14. In
Lystra it was that he and Barnabas were first deified&mdash;thought to be
gods,&mdash;and not long after nearly killed by the inhabitants of that
city. In Malta later on he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> first taken for a murderer, and then
later on deified. Paul is the only man in all the Bible history who
had such varied experiences.</p>

<p><b>164. In his second missionary journey</b> he started once
more from Antioch, and together with Silas made a tour of the
cities touched in his first journey. Then they went into Galatia,
and so on to Troas. Here it was that the vision of the man of
Macedonia came to Paul, and the result was that they crossed
over to Europe. In our last lesson we saw this army of four
start on their journey across the Hellespont, they being destined
to bring to Europe the gospel of the grace of God. For the
narrative of this journey let the scholar look up carefully Acts
15:36 to 18:22. In this tour he remained for a year and a
half at Corinth. The place where he found the least persecution
was Athens, and there too he found the least real seriousness.
The Athenians seem to have cared too little about religion to
take the trouble to persecute.</p>

<p><b>165. The third missionary journey begins in</b> Acts 18:23,
and the chief episode of this journey is that which took place in
Ephesus (Acts 19, 20). In this city Paul remained for two
years (Acts 19:10). Here was kindled the most remarkable
bonfire that the world had ever seen, it being made up of books
of incantation, that the idolaters were now willing to consign
to the flames.</p>

<p><b>166. Paul's journey to Rome</b> really begins at Jerusalem,
whither he had gone to take alms to his fellow-countrymen who
were in distress. Here he was set upon and arrested, and then
taken to C&aelig;sarea, where he appeared before Festus, Felix, and
Agrippa. Here he was delayed for more than two years. Then
he was sent to Rome on trial for his life. In this voyage the
great shipwreck occurred. (For further details of this wonderful
life, the scholar is referred to Dr. Stalker's Life of Paul,
a most wonderful and brief setting forth of the main incidents
of the life of the Apostle.)</p>

<p><b>167.</b> In all this story of Paul's labors and sufferings there are
great gaps. This is seen as soon as we compare his life, as given
in the Acts, with one statement of his to the Corinthians, as
given in 2 Corinthians 11:25-28. Put in parallel columns, so
as to bring them out, the record is as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

</tr>
</table>

<p><b>168. A Triumphant Life.</b>&mdash;Therefore, Paul was bound to the
whipping-post <i>eight times</i>, and suffered shipwreck <i>four times</i>,
while once he clung to wreckage for twenty-four hours before he could
get to land. Yet in spite of all this he could exclaim, "Wherefore I
take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in
persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake: for when I am weak,
then am I strong" (2 Cor. 12:10). And in spite of all that he suffered
he could also cry out: "I have learned, in whatsoever state I am,
therein to be content" (Phil. 4:11). It seems to us that if the
Apostle had been asked, "Where did you learn this truly wonderful
lesson?" he might have replied, "The whipping-post was my academy, and
mobs with clenched fists and paving-stones were my professors.
Fastings and perils in the deep were my college, and my midnight
vigils were kept in the inner prison. Weariness and pain were my
text-books, and kings and rulers my lecturers. Chained soldiers were
my room-mates, a thorn in the flesh was my monitor, and Christ the
crucified was Head-master."</p>

<p><b>169.</b> All agree that at last Paul suffered martyrdom in Rome,
by being beheaded. So ended the life of the most useful man of
that day, and the great leader in work among the Gentiles.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> The English Bible is the Bible of the English-speaking world.
It is used in several editions or translations. The most prominent
of these are the Authorized, or King James Version (of 1611),
and the Revised Version (of 1881-5), and the American Standard
Revision (of 1901). The recent revisions are supplied with
marginal references and notes, both to parallel and to explanatory
texts. In addition to these citations we find frequent references
to the Heb(rew), Sept(uagint), Vulg(ate), and Syr(iac) readings.
That is to say, the translators of the English Bible refer the
reader to some variant reading in one of the great Bibles of the
ancient world, for some valuable explanation of, or variant from,
the reading found on the page of the Bible being read. In other
words, we see by the margins of our English Bible, that there are
many old Bibles in different languages which scholars must
study if they give us the best that can be produced.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Every one who can read the Bible in English must recognize
the fact that our Bible is only a translation from the language
in which the books of both Testaments were originally written.
The original language of the Old Testament is Hebrew with a
few sections appearing in the Aramaic tongue; and the New
Testament is Greek. Any translator who wishes to give us an
English Bible that will be closest to the meaning intended by the
original writers, must translate out of those two languages. If
any of us has ever attempted to translate a language, he knows
how difficult it is to transfer the exact thought of one tongue into
another.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> The Hebrew language of the Old Testament is full of
picture-thoughts. It is simple in construction, and has a very small
number of words in actual use. It was the language of the Hebrew
peoples during the time of their national existence, but degenerated
into Aramaic some time after their return from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> exile. The
tremendous expressive power of the language is seen in the great
sermons of the prophets, especially Isaiah, and in the poetry of Job
and the Psalms.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> The founding and the growth of Alexandria under Greek
influence led to an epoch in the history of the Bible. Facilities
for trade and other reasons made this city attractive to the
Jews. Greek, however, was the prevailing language of the
community. Early in the third century B. C. the proportion of
Greek-speaking Jews became so large that there was a call for
their Scriptures in their adopted tongue. To supply this religious
need of the Jews, the Hebrew Bible was translated (about
280-130 B. C.) into the Greek language. This Greek Bible
contained all the books of the Hebrew Bible, and several other
small books now called "the Apocrypha."</p>

<p><b>5.</b> This Greek Bible, now called the Septuagint ("Seventy"),
so named because it was thought to have been translated from
the Hebrew by "seventy" men, became the Bible of the Old
Testament for the Greek-speaking world. In the time of our
Lord it was largely used by the New Testament writers. It
was quoted by them, and especially by Paul, almost everywhere.
It was the Bible of the early Christian church until the
conquest of Rome and the Latin tongue required a translation
into Latin. These early Latin translations of the Old Testament
were all made from the Septuagint. There were also some
scholars in the church who, not being satisfied with the translation
of the Septuagint, made translations of their own. These
were of some value to scholars, such as that most famous of all
Biblical students, Origen (186-254 A. D.) who were trying to
construct the best Greek text of the Bible.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> The many and differing Latin translations that were
current in the second, third, and fourth centuries led Jerome,
a fully equipped and competent scholar, to translate the whole
Bible from the original languages into good idiomatic Latin
(384-405). His translation differed so much from those versions
in general use that it was sharply and bitterly criticized by the
less scholarly and more hostile enemies of progress. But the
faithfulness of his translation to the original text commended it
to the most thoughtful men of the Christian church, and before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
many centuries it became the Bible of the Latin-speaking and
Latin-using world. That was the Bible adopted by the Council of
Trent, April 8, 1546, as the official Bible of the Roman Catholic
Church. With the exception of the Psalms, which is simply a
revision of an old Latin Psalter, and the apocryphal books
included in the collection, this is Jerome's translation, made
384-405, which was so drastically condemned when it first
appeared.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> In northern Syria there was a body of Christians who used
the Syrian language. Somewhere in the second century they
made, or had made for them, a translation of the Bible to aid
them in their Christian growth. The translation from Hebrew
Old Testament into Syriac was a translation from one sister
tongue into another, and was thus quite freely rendered. If
one should to-day translate from Dutch into German, he would
feel free to vary from the literal if thereby he thought he could
help bring out the meaning of the original language. This
Syriac translation, while a beautiful piece of work, was most too
freely done to be of much value to scholars who are to-day trying
to find out what the text could have been from which it was made.
There are none of the Latin Bible apocryphal books in the Syriac
version.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> These facts show us that the early Christian church in
Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Asia Minor, and Europe used the Bible
mainly in three versions, viz.: Septuagint Greek, Latin Vulgate,
and the Syriac&mdash;all valuable, prominent texts. Of Greek texts
there were several translations current among different branches
of the early church.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> When the peoples on the outskirts of civilization became
Christianized they also were provided with the Scriptures,
translated into their tongues from one of the three or four great
versions of that day. Thus we have the Bible in Arabic, Ethiopic,
Armenian, Gothic, Slavonic and a lot of other border languages.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> The Bible was introduced into England very early in the Christian
centuries, and it was one of the Latin versions current in the Western
world. This was succeeded by the Vulgate Latin. Preachers and teachers
were obliged to interpret this in the language of the native peoples.
Some fragments of these inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>pretations, paraphrases, and
translations remain to the present day, preserved in the Anglo-Saxon
or early English tongue. In the fourteenth century, Wycliffe
(1320-1384) gave us the first English Bible, translated, not from the
original Hebrew and Greek, but from the Latin Vulgate,&mdash;a translation
of a translation. This was received with slight favor by the churchmen
of that day.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> Not until the sixteenth century do we have an English Bible
translated out of the original languages of the Bible. After great
opposition and severe trial Tyndale succeeded in printing in Germany
and distributing in England an English New Testament translated from
the Greek. But his books were confiscated, and burned in London by the
church officials. Remaining on the continent and prosecuting his
translation of the Old Testament he was finally kidnapped, imprisoned,
strangled, and burned at the stake October 6, 1536&mdash;all because he
translated the Bible into English so that the common people could read
it. Within one year after his martyrdom his translation was published
under another name by royal authority, the authority of Henry VIII.
For several years English Bibles flowed from the presses of England
and the continent in several editions, most prominent of which were
"Matthew's," Coverdale's, and the Great Bible. A revulsion against
Protestantism cut off Cromwell's head and gave Bible-popularity a
setback. Edward VI (1547-3) espoused the cause of the Protestants,
while Mary Tudor (1553-8) burned at the stake many of the best men of
the times, such as Ridley, Latimer, and John Rogers. In the reign of
Queen Elizabeth (1558-1603) Bible translation and publication, both
Protestant and Catholic, made rapid progress. There were published the
Geneva version (1560), the Bishops' Bible (1568), and the Rheims New
Testament (Roman Catholic, 1582). Of all these the Geneva Bible became
the most popular.</p>

<p><b>12.</b> Early in the reign of James I (1603-25) a movement was
set on foot to provide a new and better English translation of the
Bible. Most of the eminent Biblical scholars of England set
to work and produced in 1611 the Authorized Version of the
Bible; it is a model of good English and a very faithful translation
of the original texts known at that time.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> Between 1611, the date of appearance of the Authorized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> Version,
and 1870, the date of the beginning of a revision, a period of more
than 250 years, scholars found a large number of very valuable
manuscripts of the Bible, older and nearer the lost originals than any
hitherto known. The English language, too, in that space of time, had
changed in some important particulars. During this same period,
several private attempts were made to give us a new and better
translation than the Authorized Version. Several works were produced
on the added new material of the new manuscripts now known to
scholars. In fact, there was agitation toward a new translation on the
grounds of the better Hebrew and Greek texts now at hand, of the more
thorough and comprehensive scholarship available, and of the obsolete
language of the Authorized Version.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> In 1870 steps were taken toward revision, and before many
years both a British and American Revision Committee, made up
of many of the leading British and American Biblical scholars,
were at work. After ten years of most conscientious and careful
effort the Revised Version of the New Testament appeared in
1881, and four years later, in 1885, the Old Testament appeared&mdash;thus
completing a translation on the basis of the best manuscripts
now known to the scholarly world.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> The American Revision Committee, not as conservative
as the British in the retention of old terms, words and phrases,
carefully revised the Revised Version and issued in 1901 The
American Standard Revised Version&mdash;the best edition of the
Bible in the English language.</p>

<h3>Lesson 1</h3>

<h2>Knowing the Pupil</h2>


<p><b>1.</b> There never was a time when so many people were students
of human life as to-day. Professional men, business men,
politicians, educators, parents, indeed the whole thinking world
has apparently matriculated in a college of life. What is it,
how does it develop, how may it be influenced, how led to action?
These are typical questions to which answers are sought. There
would be no value in this study were it not for the fact that
life, like all other of God's creations, is under law, and the
laws are unchangeable and universal. Certain causes will
always produce certain results under normal conditions.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Since these laws of life may be known, two conclusions follow:
first, results which are desired in a life can be intelligently
planned for; second, haphazard, ignorant work with a life becomes
culpable in proportion to the issues at stake and the opportunity for
acquiring skill in the work.</p>

<p><b>3. Why the Sunday-school Teacher should know the
Pupil.</b>&mdash;Next to fathers and mothers, the duty of understanding
life is laid most imperatively upon Sunday-school teachers.
Four unanswerable arguments present themselves as proof.</p>

<p>(1) <i>The issues are the most vital in the world.</i> The case the
lawyer seeks to win is important, but the case the teacher seeks
to win involves character, not reputation, and the outcome
is eternal.</p>

<p>(2) <i>A mistake with a life cannot be wholly rectified.</i> There is
a best time for each phase of work with a life&mdash;a time to form
habits and store memory, a time to shape ideals and to crystallize
life purposes, a time to broaden sympathies and to lead to
service; if this best time be passed, the results, if obtainable at
all later, come with greater effort and with less success.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The time is short.</i> Measured on the dial, an hour in a
week or a lifetime out of an eternity is too brief to allow of one
wasted moment, one experimental or ignorant touch upon a
soul. But measured by the duration of a given opportunity the
time is shorter still. Conditions in the life are constantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
changing, never to return in the same way again. What is
done in "buying up the opportunity," must be done quickly.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Success is largely conditioned upon obedience to God's laws.</i>
Only the Holy Spirit can make spiritual work effective, but
he always operates in accordance with God's laws. There are
conditions between the teacher and God which must be met
before he can work, and conditions between the teacher and the
pupil. These conditions or laws are not hidden and mysterious,
but may be definitely known, and in proportion as they are
obeyed will God have access to the soul of the pupil.</p>

<p><b>4. What the Teacher Should Know about the Pupil.</b>&mdash;Every
teacher owes to God and to the life he seeks to touch a
twofold knowledge: first, a knowledge of the general laws in all
life, and second, a knowledge of the individual life of each pupil.</p>

<p>(1) <i>General knowledge.</i> Since the purpose of this study of
the pupil is to afford a general knowledge of life, four preliminary
statements will suffice in this connection.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(a) Life is constantly changing. This change is evident in growth or
increase in size and development or increase in power. It occurs not
only in the body but the soul as well, or that part of life which is
not physical, and is a result of nourishing food and proper exercise.
The Sunday-school has recognized this fact of change by its division
of the life of the pupil into six periods, Beginners, Primary, Junior,
Intermediate, Senior, and Adult. These periods mark different stages
in development.</p>

<p>(b) Each period has certain predominant characteristics and out of
these characteristics arise definite opportunities and needs. To meet
these opportunities and needs is the goal of work for each period. The
final goal of developed Christian character can be attained only
through reaching the goal of each period.</p>

<p>(c) Development is gradual, constant and progressive.
The soul comes into the world containing infinite but
undeveloped possibilities. The unfolding is gradual and
constant as the possibilities are called out by the needs of
the life. There is also an order in unfolding. The soul
develops power for simple mental processes first and for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>complex later: interest in self first and in others later;
consciousness of the natural first, the spiritual later. The
teacher who knows God's order, obeys his laws and waits
his time is the teacher whose seed sowing is reaped in the
hundredfold harvest.</p>

<p>(d) It is impossible to ignore the physical and mental
side of the pupil and be successful in spiritual work with him.
The lesson cannot reach the soul save by way of physical
senses and a physical brain and mental processes identical
with those necessary in apprehending a history lesson. The
Holy Spirit applies the truth to the life but he has only so
much to apply as has been received into the mind. Therefore
pure air and bodily comfort, acute senses and obedience
to the laws of the mind are as surely linked with spiritual
work as prayer.</p></div>

<p>(2) <i>Specific knowledge.</i> Though all lives possess the same
general characteristics and are under the same general laws,
no two lives are identical. Some unfold more rapidly than
others, some have larger capacity and more latent possibilities
than others and all are in differing circumstances. It is this
variation that makes individuality, and the more perfect the
adaptation of the teacher's work to the individual the greater
the teacher's success.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p><p>Again, each life is immeasurably influenced by its environment. No
teacher can understand a pupil without knowing what has entered into
his life. "I am a part of all that I have met." The home and the daily
surroundings are the explanation of what the pupil is and an index to
what he needs. This specific knowledge can come only through close
personal observation and sympathetic intimacy with the pupil. In this
intimacy is revealed the pathway to the heart, as it winds through
ambitions and interests and love. Unless the teacher find this path to
the tender, responsive place whose gateway each soul keeps for itself,
the seed must fall on the stony ground where germination is
impossible.</p>


<h4>Test Questions</h4>

<p>1. Since laws of life are known, what two conclusions follow?</p>

<p>2. Give four reasons why the Sunday-school teacher should
know the pupil.</p>

<p>3. What twofold knowledge about the pupil should the teacher
have?</p>

<p>4. How has the Sunday-school recognized the changing life
of the pupil?</p>

<p>5. Give three characteristics of development.</p>

<p>6. How may specific knowledge of the pupil be gained by the teacher?</p>

<h3>Lesson 2</h3>

<h2>The Beginners Age, Three to Six</h2>


<p><b>5. General Characteristics</b></p>

<p>(1) <i>Absorption.</i> The Beginners period, together with the
Primary, Junior, and Intermediate periods, is pre-eminently
the absorptive time of life. As the possibilities of the soul begin
to awaken, curiosity, imitation, imagination, feeling and all
the manifold expressions of its power, they require food and
exercise just as the body requires them to develop strength.
Hence these years of most rapid development are the years of
greatest hunger, physical and mental, of greatest capacity to
receive and assimilate, and of greatest activity.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Rounded development.</i> These periods are also the years
of rounded development. Every part of the body is growing
and every power of the soul. While development is not perfectly
symmetrical and balanced, as for example, feeling developing
strength before reason, imagination before self-control, it is
nevertheless all-sided and requires in consequence nourishment
and activity in every part.</p>

<p>Conditions change as maturity approaches and development
becomes more and more narrowed to a special line. The muscles
of the blacksmith's arm increase in strength, the fingers of the
violinist grow more flexible, the imagination of the poet more
beautiful, the analytic power of the lawyer more keen, until
physical and mental power begin to break; but, outside of the
specialty, growth and development practically cease because of
the cessation of nourishment and activity on other sides.</p>


<p><b>6. Special Characteristics</b></p>

<p>(1) <i>Restlessness</i>. This is the most restless period of all the
Sunday-school life. A surplus of activity is generated in the
body, and it must be expended if the child is to be in a healthy
condition, as well as in a normal, happy mental state.</p>

<p>But the outgo of this activity should do more than merely reduce
pressure, as the escape of steam from a safety valve. It is a law of
life that we both understand and retain most thor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>oughly the thing we
do. This abounding activity is God's great provision for enabling the
child to make his own that which he is receiving through his senses.
It is handling and eating the apple that makes him understand what it
is. It is playing that he is the father or the Sunday-school teacher,
performing the act of helpfulness and love that enables him to enter
into the meaning of these relations and duties of life.</p>

<p>The problem of the Sunday-school teacher then is not "How
can I keep the child still," but "How can I make this activity
teach the child;" for, re-emphasizing the thought, "The child
understands and remembers the action far better than the
admonition."</p>

<p>(2) <i>Imitation.</i> The activity of this period is distinctly
imitative. Just as the child must learn to form letters by copying
them before he can develop an individual style of writing,
so he must learn right action by imitating it before he can be
independent and original. Every time a child imitates an action
he understands its meaning better, he fixes it more securely in
memory and he also makes its repetition so much the easier.</p>

<p>It is important, therefore, to note what he naturally imitates.
In this period it is some definite act, not the spirit nor life of the
actor. He does not aspire to resemble the character of the
teacher, but he does try to speak and move and look as she does.
As the action is performed, the life unconsciously but surely
becomes like the one who is imitated.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Curiosity.</i> Because the child has everything to learn God has
made him want to learn everything. As physical hunger arouses an
effort to supply the need for physical food, so mental hunger or
curiosity arouses an effort to supply mental food. It is most active
in the period of greatest absorption, when the life must store for
future use. There are two points in relation to curiosity which it is
important for the Sunday-school teacher to remember.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(a) Its field of operation, or that toward which it is directed.
Curiosity is selective, going out only toward those things in which
the life is interested. In this period the child's interests are in
activities in Nature and everyday life and in the things about him;
but he desires to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>know only the simplest facts concerning them. What
the object is, where it came from, and what it will do, usually
satisfy his curiosity regarding it. The teacher, therefore, is guided
in the selection of what shall be given the child in a lesson.</p>

<p>(b) Its channels of operation or that through which it acts. The
channels through which curiosity reaches out for knowledge and brings
back the results of its search are the senses. Every waking moment
finds them taking in sensations which are carried to the brain through
the nervous system. The more perfect the senses in their working the
more correct the message they bring. Failure to learn and inattention
are usually caused by some defect in the senses or other part of the
body.</p>

<p>While an adult can arrive at new ideas through other ideas, the child
must receive practically all his ideas through his senses. This guides
the teacher as to the method of presenting the lesson.</p></div>

<p>(4) <i>Fancy.</i> This is the early form of imagination, unleashed
and untrammeled, which transforms objects, gives soul to
inanimate things and creates for the child his own beautiful
play world.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Self-interest.</i> The beginner himself is the center of his little
world. His thinking and his feeling revolve around his own
personality, and his own advantage is the thing he constantly seeks.
This is God's order of development. The consideration for others will
follow later, but even now the child may be led into loving, unselfish
acts through imitation and personal influence.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Faith.</i> Perhaps the better term in the beginning would be
credulity, for faith is confidence which has a basis in knowledge, and
knowledge does not necessarily enter into a child's belief. Anything
an older person tells him is accepted unquestioningly, no matter of
what sort it may be.</p>

<p>This means a great responsibility and an unequaled opportunity in the
matter of religious instruction. The stories of God's power and the
love of Jesus Christ are absorbed into the life, neither proof nor
explanation being necessary nor indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> comprehensible. As the stories
multiply in the home and the Sunday-school that which was credulity at
first becomes genuine faith. The child does not reason that God will
do because he has done, but a feeling of the Divine strength and love
grips him and out of this feeling grows loving confidence in the One
who first loved him. If a child passes through the Beginners
department without this response, his teacher has been out of touch
with her Lord.</p>

<h3>Lesson 3</h3>

<h2>Beginners Age (Concluded)</h2>


<p><b>7. Opportunities of the Beginners Age.</b>&mdash;(1) <i>Shaping character through
influence.</i> There are two ways of touching a life&mdash;the one through
definite instruction, which must be understood to avail anything; the
other through unconscious influence which is felt, not necessarily
comprehended. The mind of the beginner is awake and active, but he can
grasp little instruction beyond simplest facts about concrete things.
Right and wrong, unselfishness, love, all the abstract standards and
principles of life, he cannot comprehend intellectually, but he
absorbs the influences that go out from them, and what is felt is
always more powerful than that which lodges only in the head. During
the first six years of life the child is peculiarly sensitive to every
influence that comes to him out of his environment, and these,&mdash;not
instruction,&mdash;determine what he shall be. No amount of teaching upon
the subject of flowers and birds and trees can arouse the joy and
gratitude which a drive through the country on a glorious spring
morning awakens. No number of lessons upon self-control will make the
impression upon the heart which the sight of it in another makes. The
child cannot understand the nature and necessity of reverence, but he
will feel it, if that be the influence of the Sunday-school hour.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Shaping character through imitation.</i> The actions in this
period which result from instruction are few compared to those
which come from the instinct of imitation; therefore what the
teacher is unable to do through precept she can accomplish
through the power of example and story.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Imparting simple spiritual truths.</i> These must be truths
with whose earthly likenesses the child is familiar. This will
make possible stories of God's power as Creator, his love and care
as Heavenly Father, stories of Jesus as the loving Friend and
Helper of little children, and the necessity of obedience to his
commands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p><b>8. Needs of the Beginners Age.</b>&mdash;If the opportunities of
this period are to be realized, four things are necessary:</p>

<p>(1) <i>A Christlike teacher.</i> While influences go out from
everything,&mdash;people, circumstances, conditions, even inanimate,
senseless things,&mdash;a human life radiates the strongest influence.
It has a twofold effect upon a little child: he not only feels the
influence, but it also moves him to imitate the person. He may
forget the lesson, he may not have comprehended it at all, but
he has absorbed the teacher during the hour and he will try
to reproduce what she has said and done even to her very tone,
expression, and manner. If his model be a gentle voice or a
loving word, the very act of imitating it makes him gentler
and more tender, and what exhortation may not secure, influence
and imitation will bring. Therefore a teacher will do her
strongest work with a beginner by being like Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>(2) <i>A suggestive atmosphere.</i>  Atmosphere represents the
sum total of all the influences at a given time. The soft music
of the organ, the dim light, the stillness, the attitude of prayer,
all create an atmosphere to which reverence and worship are the
natural response. In confusion and bustle, with loud voice
and impatient movement on the part of the teacher, there could
be only restlessness and irreverence and inattention on the part
of the child. The atmosphere must suggest to the pupil that
which the teacher desires from him, be he beginner or adult,
for feeling and action are more influenced by atmosphere than
admonition. The greatest work for the hour will have been
accomplished if the child shall feel that the Lord was in that
place, though he knew it not, intellectually.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Right direction of activity.</i> The activity of the child may
prevent his receiving any benefit from the instruction, or it may
be the most effective means for fastening impressions. It is
such a constant and prominent factor in the problem of the
hour's work that the teacher must plan beforehand just how it
shall be directed. In addition to opportunities for general
movement, such as rising for songs, or marching, every thought
given to the child should have some action immediately connected
with it as far as possible, both to help him remember it and
make it easier for succeeding actions to follow. For example<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
if the lesson is upon helpfulness, each child should be led into
doing something for his neighbor before he leaves. A prayer
attitude should accompany prayer. As this is the rhythmic
period, motions which the children themselves suggest may
accompany the songs. The results of directing the activity
into helpful channels will be found in better memory of the
lesson and in the starting of right habits of action.</p>

<p>(4) <i>An imitable activity in the lesson.</i> In simplest facts set
forth in a story of a person, not in exhortation, the lesson must
make vivid and attractive an activity which the child can
imitate. The more realistic the portrayal, the more surely will
the child attempt to reproduce it.</p>

<p><b>9. Difficulties in the Beginners Age.</b>&mdash;The difficulties of
this period arise largely from the child's immaturity and are to
be overcome by adaptation of methods and instruction.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Restlessness and lack of self-control, making sustained
attention impossible.</i> A program consisting of brief exercises,
varied in character, full of interest, and permitting frequent
movement, will meet this condition.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Limited experience and scanty store of ideas.</i> This necessitates
careful selection of teaching material, that spiritual truth
outside the child's comprehension be not forced upon him,
since he can grasp only that which is like something that he
knows.</p>

<p>(3) <i>A limited vocabulary.</i> This calls for watchful care in language,
particularly lest a familiar word be used in a sense unfamiliar to the
child.</p>

<p>(4) <i>A conflicting home atmosphere.</i> When the child absorbs influences
that lack Jesus Christ during seven days in the week, only a teacher
filled with Divine life and power can effect counter-conditions more
powerful in the brief time of her contact.</p>

<p><b>10. Results to be Expected in the Beginners Age.</b>&mdash;Summing up the
results already suggested, the work in the Beginners department will
make its impress upon the feelings of the child, primarily. He will
have learned some truths about the Heavenly Father, and his Son Jesus
Christ, and there is an intellectual value in these. But this value
cannot compare with that of the love and trust which come
unconsciously, yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> really, into his soul, if the teacher has done her
work with God.</p>

<h3>Lesson 4</h3>

<h2>The Primary Age&mdash;Six to Nine</h2>


<p><b>11. General Characteristics of the Primary Age.</b>&mdash;The Beginner is
easily traced in the Primary child, but more developed and stronger.
Two general characteristics may be specially mentioned:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Broader interests.</i> Curiosity is increasingly active concerning
things with which the senses come in contact, yet the child in the
Primary period is able to reach beyond that which he can see or
handle. He cares nothing for abstractions like missions, or
patriotism, or temperance, but his interest is genuine in the people
and actions back of the abstraction. It is a law of the soul that
interest in a certain thing will extend to other things related to it.
This makes it possible for the teacher to take the child far into the
field of knowledge, provided the starting-point be something in which
the child is naturally interested.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Greater mental power.</i> While the child does not reason as an
adult, he enjoys thinking for himself. The Primary teacher who gives
him predigested lessons, tells him everything in the picture, asks no
questions, and does not lead him on to arrive at any conclusions for
himself, not only fails to obtain results that are possible, but
really retards the child's development. Personal effort must precede
increase of strength in soul as well as body.</p>

<p><b>12. Special Characteristics of the Primary Age.</b></p>

<p>(1) <i>Physical activity.</i> In place of the restlessness of the
preceding period, activity directed toward more definite ends
appears. It is very important that the activity be expended
rightly, since its use in every action strengthens some one of the
rapidly forming habits.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Power of perception.</i> This is the ability of the mind to
understand the sensations which senses and nerves send to the
brain, or to interpret their meaning; as, for example, to know that
the round yellow ball is an orange, or to recognize the different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
details in a picture. Perception grows constantly more quick
and active as the child's store of knowledge increases. Two
things must be remembered: (<i>a</i>) the teacher must be sure that
the first idea of anything is the correct one, for it will be eradicated
with difficulty, and upon it all future thinking in that line
will be based; (<i>b</i>) since each sensation produces an idea embodying
itself, and it is on these ideas that the soul is nourished,
character must grow in quality like its food. "Tell me what
you eat and I will tell you what you are."</p>

<p>(3) <i>Memory.</i> The mind has greater power to retain that
which is given to it than in the preceding period, though it holds
these facts disconnectedly rather than related into systematic
knowledge, as they will be later. But this power of retention
must not be abused through storing memory with a quantity of
useless material. That which is impressed upon the plastic,
non-resisting cells of the child's brain ought to have some
immediate meaning and value for the life at a time when the
intellectual and spiritual needs are so many.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Imagination.</i> This is the power of the mind to make
living and real that which is not present to the senses. It is one
of the most striking characteristics of the Primary period and
one of the most important as well. The imagination works only
with concrete things in childhood, making new objects out of
the old, making the story and the mental picture as real as the
tangible experience, making Jesus an actual present Helper and
Friend. Later it will work with abstract ideas and ideals of
life formed from the pictures it has cherished.</p>

<p><b>13. Opportunities of the Primary Age.</b></p>

<p>(1) <i>Character building through the mental picture.</i> Abstract ideas
about which the mind reasons do not have power over the soul of
the child. It is the vivid picture which imagination holds that
arouses the feeling and impels the action. So great is the power
of the picture that the teacher need not exhort and admonish
concerning what ought to be done. She only need set forth the
action in a story that appeals, and imagination will do the
rest. While very many of these pictures come unconsciously
to the child from his environment, it is the privilege of the
teacher definitely and carefully to provide the highest type of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
mental picture through the well-selected story, in order to secure
the finest action.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Increased knowledge of Bible facts.</i> The lesson may
contain more than in the earlier period, because the child's
interest in details has increased and he has greater power of
attention. It is important to note, however, in what the
increase may consist. It is not in the number of truths presented
in the lesson, but in the number of details concerning the
one truth for which the lesson stands. Since the mind has
developed new power to hold the impressions which are made
upon it, Scripture verses containing fundamental truths, like
God's love and care, the duty of love toward him and others,
and the necessity of obedience may be given, with explanation,
for memorizing.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Service prompted through imitation and personal influence.</i>
The activity should even now be tracing pathways in the
brain that shall mean life habits of loving service for others.
There is this difference, however, between service in childhood
and later. The motives must now be supplied and strengthened
by others; later the promptings will come from within.</p>

<p><b>14. Needs of the Primary Age.</b>&mdash;In addition to the needs
mentioned in the Beginners period, and which still obtain, there
are two to be especially borne in mind.</p>

<p>(1) <i>The absolute necessity of knowing how to make spiritual
truth live in story form.</i> The child can receive it in no other
way, and there is therefore no substitute for a rightly prepared
story given by a spiritually prepared teacher.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The necessity for the child to learn obedience in the use of
his activity.</i> This is to be secured not by force, but because the
one to whom it is to be rendered wins it through love and the
power of personality.</p>

<p><b>15. Difficulties in the Primary Age.</b>&mdash;There will still be
difficulties in attention and in confining the instruction to that
which the child can really grasp, but the greatest difficulty will
center about the activity. Yet the whole problem will be
solved with no harsh question of discipline if the child is kept
constantly busy with that in which he is interested.</p>

teacher has met her opportunity, there will be growing love to
Jesus Christ, the beginning of service for him, and deep down
in the soul of the child an increasing store of material out of
which life ideals are to be fashioned in the days to come.</p>

<h3>Lesson 5</h3>

<h2>Junior Age&mdash;Nine to Twelve</h2>


<p><b>17. General Characteristics.</b>&mdash;A broad survey of this period
reveals the fact that in a peculiar way God is preparing life for
entrance upon the larger opportunities and responsibilities of
maturity. There is new physical strength, new intellectual
vigor, greater power of absorption and assimilation, a wider
diffusion of interest. The curiosity of earlier years becomes a
real spirit of investigation along lines of interest, and questioning,
not alone to find out facts, but also foundations of belief begins
to appear. The individuality of each child stands out more
distinctly and emphasizes itself in two marked ways&mdash;first, the
desire for prominence, and, second, an independence of spirit
and action. Yet, with all this independence, the boys and
girls are easily dealt with if authority is administered by one
whose personality has commanded respect and love.</p>

<p><b>18. Specific Characteristics.</b></p>

<p>(1) <i>Energy,&mdash;physical and mental.</i> Though this has already been
referred to in a general way, it must have special mention as one of
the most marked and important features of the Junior period. Physical
vigor is apparent in the force of bodily movements so trying to
sensitive nerves&mdash;God's provision for the excess of nervous activity.
It also appears in the type of games belonging to this period and the
intensity with which they are played. The new mental power is evident
in the ability to perform more difficult and complex mental tasks, to
reason more clearly, and to attend more closely.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Development of the social instinct.</i> These years mark the rapid
development of insistent and insatiable desire for close companionship
with others. There are no standards of attainment nor social
distinctions according to which friends are chosen. The "gang" or the
club is based entirely on kinship of spirit among those of the same
age and sex. Often geographical lines enter in, and the boys of a
certain street or district will band together, and not uncommonly be
the sworn enemies of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> other gangs for no more valid reason than love
of contest, growing out of the instinct of rivalry. But this martial
aspect of gang life is not a characteristic of all the social tendency
of the period. There is a drawing of child to child for peaceable
purposes, the joy of common sympathies and interests and the fun of
expeditions and good times together. This social awakening is God's
plan for leading the life into larger relationships preparatory to
taking its place in the world. What the companionship is in its
influence upon character and ideals is the serious question for the
home and the Sunday-school teacher.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Hero-worship.</i> This is pre-eminently the hero-worshiping
period, with all that means in incentive to effort, in patterns of
life, in imitation, in character-building. In mature years, the
ideal of life is either a composite from many lives or, if it be one
individual, a dissected individual, certain qualities picked out
for admiration and emulation,&mdash;and over the rest, a mantle of
charity. This analysis of character and discrimination is
possible only to an intelligent and developed life. The child
accepts his hero in his entirety. Whatever he does is right and
is the goal of effort in imitation.</p>

<p>The physical element enters largely into the ideal of this
period because of the prominence of the physical in the child's
life, and, unhappily, physical and moral strength are not always
balanced. Too much of the literature written to supply the
ravenous desire of this age for reading portrays physical strength
in criminal and in daredevil molds, and the moral side of the
ideal is not only unfed, but perverted. The Sunday-school
teacher must help the home at this point to supply the boys
and girls, through books and living personality, with all the
elements of worthy and imitable ideals, since the task of finally
shaping these ideals lies in the years just beyond.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Memory in the height of its power.</i> The broader the
responsibilities to be assumed, the greater the demand upon the
soul's resources to meet them. Just at the threshold of a larger
life, the mind comes into its greatest power of retention. During
the years from about nine to fifteen, conditions never to return
so favorably make possible the fullest, broadest, and more
accurate storing of the mind. The exact wording of a passage of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Scripture is as easy to secure as the general sense of its meaning.
Whole chapters do not tax the pupil beyond his mental ability.
The mechanical, literal side of instruction, which deals with
maps and names and facts about the Word, written and incarnate,
should now be given. Held tenaciously and exactly in memory,
they will reveal the spiritual treasure they contain to the larger
spiritual vision of the next period. The careful selection and
explanation of that which is to be memorized, so necessary in
the preceding period, is not as necessary during these years.
The enlarged experience of the child will make some meaning
inhere in everything which is brought to him, so that it is not the
dead weight it would have been earlier. Yet an abundant
supply of food, intellectual and spiritual, for the present needs
of an active, investigating, and tempted life must not be overlooked
in eagerness to store for the future.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Habit formation.</i> The two physical conditions necessary
for habit formation, easily impressed brain cells, and activity
making these impressions, are at their best during this period.
Every time an act is performed, a nervous force passes through
the brain, stimulating nerves and muscles to action, and leaving
the trace of its passage. Each repetition of the action
deepens the tracing, until little pathways are established, and
the nervous force follows these naturally and involuntarily.
Sooner than is realized the pathway is so deep that only by
effort can a given thought or nervous stimulus express itself
in any other way than by passing through the accustomed
channels out into the old action,&mdash;and this is habit.</p>

<p>The early stages are easy, usually unconscious, but any change
when the path is deep and the cells hardened means greatest
effort, and often unavailing struggle with self. The drunkard
who in his sober moments implores the saloon-keeper to refuse
him liquor, no matter how he may plead for it later, reveals the
fact that habit or the tendency to follow the old brain paths
may become stronger than desire and will and all outer human
influence and incentives combined. Therefore the habit-forming
period, when pathways may be traced in any direction, becomes
one of the most responsible and wonderful of the life.</p>

<h3>Lesson 6</h3>

<h2>Junior Age (Concluded)</h2>


<p><b>19. Opportunities of the Junior Age.</b>&mdash;No period offers opportunities
bearing more directly and openly upon the formation of character than
the Junior period, when manhood- and womanhood-to-be are so rapidly
determining. Out of these opportunities five may be selected as most
significant:</p>

<p>(1) <i>The opportunity to gain spiritual ends through social means.</i> The
more a teacher can enter into the fun-loving, companionship-craving
side of the pupil's heart, the greater his power over that life for
distinctly spiritual things. It is after the party or the picnic or
the tramp together that the personal message can be spoken.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The opportunity to arouse and to guide the pupil's effort
through heroic ideals.</i> Sermonizing on what they should do is practically
valueless with boys and girls of this age, for considerations
of duty weigh little until the larger moral consciousness of the
next period. Furthermore, they live but for the day, and do not
appreciate the relationship between present action and future
character. What they may do later as a result of their own
convictions and understanding, they may be inspired to do now
through the hero who has aroused their admiration and desire
of imitation.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The opportunity to establish right habits of life.</i> The pathways
of service through which the Christian life ought to express itself
must be definitely and painstakingly traced in this period and the
next. Motives for the action may not be the highest, and must
often be supplied by another. For example, the daily Bible reading
that ought to be prompted by real love for the Word later may
now be done for love of the teacher&mdash;or because the promise
was given, but in any event it is leaving its indelible impress&mdash;and
making the "Quiet Hour" more assured in the future.</p>

<p>(4) <i>The opportunity to build Bible knowledge into character.</i>
Impressions are necessary and effective in their place, but
something more definite is needed for stability of character.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
The opportunity of supplementing impressions with facts is
the one offered by this Golden Memory period. Two points
should be noted:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>a</i>) The mind is growing in its power to associate facts.
The association of events around a person or a place is
easily made now, and toward the end of the period sequences
of time and cause and effect are grasped.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The Holy Spirit can bring to the remembrance only
that which has been in the mind. Therefore the teacher
who stores the memory at this time with Scripture passages
makes it possible for God to speak to the heart in later years.</p></div>

<p>(5) <i>The opportunity to lead to open confession of Jesus Christ.</i> This
is not to force, it is not to play upon the child's emotions, and lead
him to do that which has no foundation in a consciousness of his own
relation to Christ, but something is radically wrong in the home and
something lacking in the teacher's work, if the boys and girls do not
really love the Lord Jesus in this period. They do not understand it
all, but the essentials of a Christian life they may have,&mdash;love,
faith, penitence for wrongdoing, and the desire to serve Christ. Their
experience cannot be that of an adult, for they have not his insight.
But just as surely as the love and caress of the child is precious and
acceptable to a mother even before there can be any comprehension on
his part of the sacrificial character of mother-love, so is child-love
precious and accepted with the Master even before the child grasps the
great spiritual contents.</p>

<p><b>20. Needs of the Junior Age.</b></p>

<p>(1) <i>The presentation of Christianity as something to do rather
than to be.</i> The boys and girls do not live in inner experiences
in these years, but in outward, energetic action; therefore,
what they may do for Jesus Christ and others needs emphasis.
This presentation also includes a Christ who appeals to boyhood
and girlhood, the wonder-worker of Mark, the God-Man of Matthew
and Luke, and the victorious King of Revelation.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Opportunities for service.</i> These must be carefully devised
by the teacher, with the twofold purpose of giving immediate
expression to the desire to do something and leading to the
formation of habits of Christian activity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) <i>Christian heroes.</i> The teacher ought to be a Christian
hero himself. Out of missionary literature, out of the lives of
great men who have lived, out of Bible characters, heroes must
be multiplied. The Sunday-school lessons ought to be hero
studies, not sermons. Heroic literature ought to be put into
the hands of the children&mdash;either directly or through indirect
suggestion in some curiosity-arousing reference to the story.
This means the most effective type of instruction during all the
week as well as Sunday.</p>

<p>(4) <i>A lesson requiring work on the part of the pupil.</i> Telling a
Junior class primary stories will deplete it in numbers and weaken
it in strength. Assigned work to be prepared at home, questions,
note-books, map-making, anything to stimulate and utilize the
activity of mind and body through interest, not compulsion, is
the great necessity of the lesson hour.</p>

<p><b>21. Difficulties of the Junior Age.</b>&mdash;Three difficulties may
be encountered.</p>

<p>(1) <i>A misdirected energy.</i> Energy means finest growth and
development if it is under direction and control, but devastation
otherwise. The key to the situation is in the teacher's
personality, plus a plan for the hour's work, appealing to interest
and calling for constant activity, either mental or physical, on the
part of the pupil.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Evil associates.</i> The teacher cannot guard the child
through the seven days of a week; often the home does not, and
in this new social interest there is a danger from evil associates.
Better pastoral work by the teacher, a closer co-operation with
the home, and substitutive&mdash;not prohibitive&mdash;measures avail
much in meeting this difficulty.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The enticement of bad literature.</i> This period and the
next are the time of greatest hunger for reading and there is a
real danger from the temptations of pernicious books. Satan
has emissaries on the school-grounds and in the candy store, and
boys and girls are his shining marks. The substitutive measures
here again are the only wise and effective ones.</p>

<p><b>22. Results to be Expected in the Junior Age.</b>&mdash;The results
of work in this period ought to appear in an increase in Bible
knowledge, the strengthening of right habits and manly ideals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
of life, and back of it all the warm love of boyhood and girlhood
for the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<h3>Lesson 7</h3>

<h2>The Intermediate Age&mdash;Twelve to Sixteen</h2>


<p><b>23. General Character of the Period of Adolescence.</b>&mdash;The
Intermediate age ushers in a time known as adolescence, including
the years approximately from twelve to twenty-four, during which
life passes from childhood to maturity. The period is marked
by the development of new physical powers, new emotions, new
ideals and conceptions of life, and a new spiritual consciousness.
The change from the old life to the new, from the narrow to the
broad, from interests selfish and small to interests as far-reaching
as the world and eternity, is often accompanied by more or less
upheaval in the soul and this period of re-adjustment may be
a time of "storm and stress."</p>

<p>Two facts out of the many suggest the critical nature of adolescence:</p>

<p>(1) During these years the pupil is most susceptible to the power
of influence. It does not touch his life simply as an impression,
but as an impelling, determining force inciting him to action.</p>

<p>(2) Life rarely changes in its tendencies and character after
full maturity has come. There is a physical reason for this in
the hardening of the brain which fixes the pathways of habit and
renders new lines of thought and action difficult. Therefore, in
all probability as life emerges from adolescence will it enter
eternity.</p>

<p><b>24. General Characteristics of the Intermediate Age.</b>&mdash;Many
of the characteristics of the Junior age are still evident,
though modified by fuller development. Physical energy has
increased and the mind has greater power, especially in its ability
to reason. No disillusioning has come to destroy the old hero-worship,
but with even more intensity each life clings to that one
who embodies its aspirations. The hunger for general reading
reaches its climax in this period, to be succeeded by specialized
interest in lines determined by the taste of the individual.</p>

<p>Lacking still the self-control of manhood, breaking from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
old life and dimly apprehending as yet the meaning of the new,
under the domination of impulse and influence as well as of dawning
conviction, the Intermediate age offers particularly trying
problems with its great opportunities.</p>

<p><b>25. Special Characteristics of the Intermediate Age.</b></p>

<p>(1) <i>The functioning of new physical powers.</i> This is one of the
most significant changes in the Intermediate period, because of
its physical effects and its reflex influence upon the mental and
emotional life. Severe temptations often have to be met, questioning
and unwise introspection, and the teacher ought to be a
confidential friend as well as instructor.</p>

<p>(2) <i>A condition of instability and easy excitation.</i> The nervous
system is abnormally sensitive and quickly disturbed. The
mind is keyed to vigorous, intense, and often unbalanced thought,
but it is in the feelings that the lack of poise is most manifest.
Whether the teacher can assign causes or not, he is conscious
that the emotions are a veritable tinder-box, easily kindled into
a great fire by a very little matter. Superlatives, slang, and the
highest pitches of enthusiasm are common experience, and because
action and reaction are equal and opposite, periods of depression
corresponding to those of exhilaration are almost inevitable.</p>

<p>(3) <i>A new personal consciousness.</i> There are several marked
evidences of its existence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(a) Care for appearance. In the beginning of this period, what others
think is a matter of supreme indifference, but it is not long before a
desire to appear well manifests itself. Solicitude as to one's
personal looks is supplemented by anxiety over the condition of the
home, the standing of the family, the social position and dress of the
companions. Naturally, judgment of others is based on outward
appearance rather than on real worth of character.</p>

<p>(b) Desire for appreciation. An intense longing is experienced to have
talents, accomplishments, wits, efforts&mdash;everything which pertains to
self valued at par or above. For this cause there is frequent public
parade of wares, as in the case of the smart youth or the girl who
draws attention to herself by loud talking and laughter. The same
longing works self-consciousness, embarrassment, and awk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>wardness
in others who feel themselves deficient, neither class as yet
apprehending the truth that character, not external show, wins the
truest meed of praise from the world.</p>

<p>(c) A sense of approaching manhood and womanhood.
This makes the life sensitive beyond expression to reproof
or criticism, particularly in public. It also explains the
restlessness and desire to enter at once upon the life-work.</p></div>

<p>(4) <i>Increasing Social Appetite.</i> The boy who said in answer
to a remonstrance over his presence in the billiard hall and bowling
alley, "A fellow has got to have fun somewhere," voiced the
sentiment of all his confr&egrave;res in the Intermediate period. The
desire for good times is paramount, and its right indisputable
in the conception of the young people. The delight in healthy
outdoor sports continues with the athletically inclined, and ought
to be fostered as a safety valve for surplus energy, a diverter of
self-centered thought, and a tonic for excitable nerves. In the
latter part of this period, however, the love of fun gives place to
a love of functions, either the helpful sort of social commingling
or the danger-filled type, marked by late hours, excitement, and
overwrought imagination. This transition comes from a growing
mutual attraction between the sexes which has succeeded
the repulsion evident in the early part of the period.</p>

<p>(5) <i>The Development of the Altruistic Feelings.</i>  Though
these feelings are not unknown to childhood, their vigorous
development does not begin until the Intermediate period. The
pupil now experiences an impulse from within to sacrifice for
others and make his life a source of blessing. The new sense of
God and his claims intensifies and vitalizes the desires. Unselfishness
appears, interest in the welfare of others as well as self,
and willingness to do for them even at personal cost. These are
the feelings that make it possible to say "Brother," and to love
the neighbor as one's self. They can come only as the meaning
of life is better understood. They can remain only as they are
given constant expression in action.</p>

<p>(6) <i>A Spiritual Awakening.</i> Even though the pupil may
be a genuine Christian, there comes to him at this time a larger
consciousness of God and the soul's relation to him, and with it
a call to full surrender. Whereas the childhood relation to God<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
was based on feeling, there is now the element of will-power which
must ratify by deliberate choice that which love has prompted.
If the pupil is not a Christian, this awakening comes as God's
call to accept Jesus Christ as Saviour and crown him Lord of
the life as well. If the call is not heeded now, its tones grow less
and less distinct, until, in the strident cries of the world, they
may be silenced forever.</p>

<h3>Lesson 8</h3>

<h2>The Intermediate Age (Concluded)</h2>


<p><b>26. Opportunities of the Intermediate Age.</b>&mdash;There is a significant
difference in the purpose of the opportunities presented
during childhood and during adolescence. If they were to be
summed up in key-words, that for childhood would be absorption;
for adolescence, adjustment.</p>

<p>The opportunities of childhood converge toward supplying the
soul with material needful for growth&mdash;influences, impressions,
and a mass of facts more or less unconnected in the beginning.
But this is only the first step in character building. These materials
must be arranged, facts must be related to one another, and
the life must be related to other lives in real interest, sympathy,
and service. This process of relating fact to fact, life to life,
and each soul anew to God is the paramount task of adolescence,
even though absorption continues with almost unabated strength.</p>

<p>Analyzing the opportunities which are presented to the Intermediate
teacher in this new adjustment of life, three stand out
prominently:</p>

<p>(1) <i>The opportunity to foster high ideals.</i> Whether it be consciously
defined or not, every one has that toward which ambitions
and effort go forth, and this ideal determines what character
shall be. No one can give an ideal to another, as a book is handed
over, for it is a personal thing, to be fashioned by each soul for
itself out of that which it has absorbed through the years.</p>

<p>It is in the transition from childhood to maturity that every
life decides what (for it) seems most worth while, and to this ideal
makes surrender of thought, desire, and effort. Is not God's
gracious purpose evident, in that this is the time when life is
most easily influenced?</p>

<p>(2) <i>Opportunity to develop self-reliance.</i> A life cannot count
for God and for others unless it can make decisions and meet tests
by itself. The power to do this comes only through effort to do
it. During the Intermediate age, the young people may be more
and more thrown upon their own resources, permitted to decide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
matters for themselves, learning wiser judgment through mistakes
as well as successes. One of the most serious errors on the part of
the teacher lies at this very point, dictating instead of suggesting,
choosing for the pupil instead of allowing him to choose, thinking
for him instead of stimulating every power of his soul to rise to
a personal solution of the problem in hand. If strength and
independence of character do not come in these years of adjustment,
the probabilities are that life will always be weak and
vacillating.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The opportunity to strengthen the altruistic feeling or "love for
the other."</i>&mdash;In the broadening and deepening experience of
adolescence such conceptions as love, suffering, sacrifice, and
surrender reveal a new meaning and strange force of attraction. No
opportunity comparable to the one presented in this awakening ever
returns, as the soul, with life before it, stands at the divergence of
the paths, one leading toward God and service, the other away from him
into self, and deliberate, decisive choice to be made.</p>

<p>If through the influence of the Holy Spirit the pathway of
service be chosen, two laws of God tend to make it permanent;
(a) The law of growth and development. If the feelings have
proper nourishment, <i>i. e.</i>, something to arouse them, and are
given expression in action, they will just as surely grow strong
as a well-nourished, vigorous body, and obviously, the stronger
the feelings of loving interest, the more assured is the life of service.
(b) The law of habit. A feeling will become habitual if
continually indulged and expressed, and it is during adolescence
that habits are permanently fixed.</p>

<p><b>27. Needs of the Intermediate Age.</b>&mdash;The needs of this period
are of two sorts&mdash;important and imperative. It is exceedingly
important that the pupil be treated with consideration, respect,
and appreciation, that he be given good literature, that he be
guarded and guided in his social life. It is imperative, however,
that he be established in the right relation to God and to his
neighbor at this time of new consciousness of these relationships.
Four things will definitely further this supreme end:</p>

<p>(1) <i>The teacher with the vision of what may be done.</i> If he is
not disobedient to the vision, it will lead him to close fellowship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
with God and the pupil, for two things are evident,&mdash;he cannot
lead the pupil unless he is in sympathetic touch with him, nor
can he lead him to any higher place than he himself occupies.
If he be in vital relation with God and live with the pupil in his
ambitions, discouragements, successes, temptations, the most
dynamic external force that can operate in this period will be
his to wield, namely, a spiritual personal influence.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Definite decisions.</i>  The danger-point in this crisis lies
in permitting these newly awakened feelings to be dissipated
without decision and action. If this occurs they weaken, the
impulse to take the right stand lessens, and irresolution finally
becomes the tacit choice of the self-seeking life.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Definite responsibilities.</i> A life of service is made up of
definite servings. The beauty and duty of loving sacrifice appeal
to the emotions, but a concrete thing to be done calls the will
into action. To every pupil should be given definite tasks both
in the class itself and in the church, in order to arouse effort and
make the thought of service habitual.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Definite objects of benevolence.</i> The teachers of the
Intermediate age can almost determine when the world shall be given to
Jesus Christ. At no time can a permanent interest in missionary
enterprises and philanthropies at home be so easily launched as now if
the subjects considered be concrete, enthusiastically presented on a
basis of facts, and followed by definite response in gift, prayer, or
service.</p>

<p><b>28. Difficulties in the Intermediate Age.</b></p>

<p>(1) Lack of mental balance and consequent instability of
conduct.</p>

<p>(2) The fascination of the social world and the growing interest
of each sex in the other.</p>

<p>(3) The half-way position between childhood and maturity
which retains the immaturity of childhood, but feels the selfhood
of the man.</p>

<p>(4) The attraction of the external rather than of intrinsic
worth. In this is the key to many of the problems. What
appears to advantage allures, even if it be not the best. This
gives superficial standards of measuring people and things and
easily opens the way to harmful influences at the critical time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
when ideals and life purposes are forming. The teacher himself
is the most important factor in the solution of these problems,
not by any attempt to force, but by a patient, suggestive, and
inspiring touch upon the pupil's life.</p>

<p><b>29. Results to be Expected.</b>&mdash;The pupil ought to leave this
period in the right attitude toward God and toward his neighbor.
To render this attitude strong and unchangeable is the work of
the next period.</p>

<h3>Lesson 9</h3>

<h2>The Senior Age&mdash;Sixteen to Maturity</h2>


<p><b>30. General Characteristics of the Senior Age.</b>&mdash;The Senior age
includes the two periods technically known as middle adolescence, from
about sixteen to eighteen, and later adolescence, from eighteen to
full maturity, about twenty-four. Of these, the earlier period is the
climax of the "tempest-tossed" years. The later period witnesses the
final adjustment of the pupil to life and its problems. These years
are marked by uncertainty because the pupil does not understand
himself, by emotional upheaval connected with the development of the
deeper feelings of the soul, and by a struggle between the old ideal
of selfishness and the new ideal of service.</p>

<p><b>31. Special Characteristics of the Senior Age.</b></p>

<p>(1) <i>Continued development of the higher feelings.</i> The power
of the soul to feel for others, appearing in the Intermediate age,
has grown stronger if properly nurtured. In addition there
comes a new love for the beauties of Nature and a reverence for
her laws, a love of the arts and the great causes that men espouse.
There is the thrill of awakening love between man and woman.
Highest of all, the soul is now able to give response to the right
simply because it is the right. Duty has real meaning and conviction
becomes a motive power.</p>

<p>As the large vision of what life may be dawns upon the soul, unbounded
enthusiasm and courage possess it. There are no heights too dizzy to
be reached, no obstacles too difficult to overcome. But enthusiasm
often alternates with depression and self-distrust, leading to
indifference, apathy, or recklessness. This is the explanation of the
vacillating conduct almost universal during the early part of this
period.</p>

<p>A critical spirit toward others is common, as merciless scrutiny
reveals how far the majority come from the high standards of
life so newly appreciated. The frank openness of childhood has
been succeeded by a tendency to shut the deeper thoughts and
feelings away from others, and while there is an unspeakable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
longing to share problems and perplexities, the veil is not easily
drawn aside.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The rapid development of the reasoning power of the mind.</i>
This crowning expression of the intellectual power of the mind
has not been wanting before, but it comes to full flower in this
period. In the first delight of being able to see inner relationships,
to argue, to relate cause and effect, reason is given the
place of honor and everything must pass in review before it.
This very often precipitates a conflict between reason and faith
through failure to see that a thing is not necessarily opposed to
reason even if it cannot be understood by reason; and a period
of doubt in religious matters may ensue.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Maturing of the will power.</i> This makes possible self-control,
gives power to act independent of the impulse and influence which
always determines a child's actions, power to hold steadily to a
certain course even against strong opposition. This is the kingly
possession of the soul with which Almighty God has chosen to leave
freedom. But the soul tends to act as it has formed the habit of
acting through the years under the direction of others. In the light
of this fact, the importance of the earlier work of the teacher is
emphasized.</p>

<p><b>32. Opportunities of the Senior Age.</b>&mdash;The opportunities
discussed in the Intermediate age still obtain in this period, but
to them may be added three peculiarly favorable at this time.</p>

<p>(1) <i>The opportunity to give help in choice of life vocation.</i>
The choice of that place where each shall invest his life is one of
the most serious and complex problems that the pupil has to meet.
Loving and sympathetic counsel often stimulates a young man
or woman to aspire in the choice instead of settling down into
easy mediocrity. The call of the ministry, the mission field,
settlement work, every vocation involving the setting aside of
selfish ambitions, is most loudly heard at this time, and often a
word is sufficient to turn the decision in that direction.</p>

<p>(2) <i>To strengthen foundations of faith.</i> The questioning of
this period makes it possible to ground belief in the verities of
the Christian religion. Faith need not be blind. God gives a
reasonable basis for all he asks us to accept. The careful study
of facts which are the starting-point of faith will help the doubting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
soul to trust beyond the point of sight, and enable him to give
a reason for the hope that is in him.</p>

<p>(3) <i>To establish broad interests.</i> If the pupil is narrow and
circumscribed in his thought at this time, the fault lies in large
measure at the teacher's door, for every impulse is to stretch
in interest to the farthest limit in every direction. There will
never again be such an opportunity to establish the world-wide
interests begun in the Intermediate age, for life settles in a groove
in adulthood and new interests do not readily appeal.</p>

<p><b>33. Needs of the Senior Age.</b></p>

<p>(1) <i>The influence of lives that will bear the test.</i> In this doubting,
critical period of life, the daily life of others is the unanswerable
argument for or against the power of the gospel. If for no
other reason than to establish the faith of her young people, the
church ought to walk in white.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Sympathy and confidence toward the pupil.</i> Some one has
said that the word "hunger" will express the period of adolescence,
and for nothing is the pupil so hungry as to be understood,
appreciated, and trusted. The teacher is privileged to live into
the life of the pupil at every point, and be the sympathetic friend
who shall help him to work out his high calling in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p><b>34. Difficulties of the Senior Age.</b>&mdash;The very things that constitute
the strength of this period present many of its difficulties. The
greater mental power coming with increased reason and will is apt to
give rise to self-sufficiency and the doubt already mentioned.
Opinions are readily and dogmatically launched, and to reverse them
wounds pride. Advice may be secretly welcomed and outwardly scorned.
This is the period when there is danger that wisdom may perish if the
youth meet an untimely end. But far more dangerous is the tendency
toward the sowing of wild oats which is so often evident. A certain
recklessness easily grows out of the disturbed emotional nature and
excesses lie not far beyond. For all of these difficulties, faith and
prayer, an attitude of helpfulness at every point, and the love that
never fails, afford the only solution.</p>

<p><b>35. Results to be Expected.</b>&mdash;As the pupil emerges from the
period of development into maturity, he ought to be "strong in
the grace that is in Christ Jesus," with interest and love as broad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
as that of his Master, and "thoroughly furnished unto every good
work."</p>

<h3>Lesson 10</h3>

<h2>Maturity.</h2>


<p>The limited space of a single chapter permits only a suggestive
discussion of this important period, so often neglected in the
study of the pupil.</p>

<p><b>36. General Survey.</b>&mdash;(1) <i>Keyword, "Service."</i> As childhood's task is
absorption, and the task of youth adjustment, so the task of maturity
is service. That which has been taken in must be given out again,
enriched and enlarged by its stay in the soul. This is "the last of
life for which the first was made," and to fail here means to miss the
meaning of living.</p>

<p>All the factors necessary for service are now ready. Experience and
study have supplied something to give, mental discipline and
unimpaired physical strength supply the power for service, the broad
outlook reveals the need and place of service, and the soul's
awakening toward God and the neighbor have supplied the motives for
service.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Physical and mental power at the height.</i> Waste and repair
in bodily tissues are balanced during the prime of life. If
development has been normal, the will is resolute, and judgment
and reason are dominating and wise, for experience has given
large data from which to draw conclusions. While the "Golden
Age of Memory" is far in the past, the power of retaining new
knowledge through the old is strong. To enter upon unfamiliar
lines of thought, however, at this time and achieve any mastery
is a mark of genius at least for hard work. The soul has capacity
now for the highest feelings that can stir the heart of man, yet
the character of those it really experiences is determined by what
life has been feeding upon. The love, joy, and peace which give
glory to maturity and old age grow alone out of thought upon
true and pure and lovely things and those of good report.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Development specialized, not general.</i> Out of the many
calls and lines of interest, each life has made choice of one or more,
according to taste and circumstances. Along these lines growth
and development proceed. It is not that life could not continue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
the many-sided expansion of adolescence, but growth demands
nourishment, development demands activity. The need for
the expert, the multiplicity of cares and the force of habit make
it difficult to "keep up" along many avenues.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Time of achievement.</i> Achievement may or may not be that service
which manhood owes. The purpose in the task determines that. To souls
especially endowed and favorably environed come the riches of
intellectual research, of creation in the arts, of successes in the
business world. To the many, achievement means only struggle here, but
waiting treasures laid up with God.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Time of soul hunger.</i> The teacher of men and women
always faces hungry hearts. If the soul has not found satisfaction
in God, the pangs of starvation are inevitably there. If
the soul does know God, there is unspeakable longing for a
clearer revelation and a deeper consciousness that in the midst
of life's weakness and aspiring</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"God's goodness flows around our incompleteness,<br />
Round our restlessness His rest."<br />
</p></div>

<p><b>37. Opportunities Presented in Maturity.</b>&mdash;But three great
opportunities out of the many can be suggested:</p>

<p>(1) <i>The opportunity to be somebody's ideal.</i> Every successful life is
the pattern for some eager, ambitious boy or girl. Did not Paul's
exhortation to Timothy look toward this as well, when he besought him
to "be an ensample in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in
purity"?</p>

<p>(2) <i>The opportunity to count for the kingdom.</i> There are two
lines of Christian work which call loudly to-day to men and
women&mdash;personal evangelism and the missionary enterprise.
These are the doors most imperative for the soul in possession
of power, experience, and resources to enter. Beyond these
doors lies the solution of every one of the world's problems.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The opportunity to grasp the doctrines of Christianity.</i> The
relation of truth to truth cannot come until the mind can deal
with the abstract. The little child grasps some of the facts of
Christianity, but the adult mind has the power to deal with
infinite reaches of truth, interdependent and self-illuminating.
This is the "solid food for full-grown men."</p>

<p><b>38. Needs of Maturity.</b>&mdash;(1) <i>Adequate spiritual nourishment.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p><p>The time of disillusionment has come, much of the optimism
and buoyancy of youth have gone. Life is found to be a struggle
even with its victories, and responsibilities and sorrows weigh.
The teaching must present a Saviour and a salvation sufficient
for great heart needs. It is for the deep things of God that life's
experiences have made mature souls hungry, and there is pathos
in the superficial dole meted out by so many teachers&mdash;superficial
because they themselves have never lived "down deep."</p>

<p>(2) <i>The broad outlook.</i> To busy men and burdened women,
the class ought to be a place of vision. Absorbed in one's tiny
corner through six toiling days, the seventh should give opportunity
to lift up the eyes and look on fields glorious in their
incoming harvest. There is refreshment and inspiration and
incentive now in the news from China and Japan and the islands
of the sea. The teacher must bring the world-view to the class
if he believes that world service is God's thought for manhood.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Emphasis on personal responsibility.</i> This is the pivotal
point upon which a life of service turns, and it ought to be the
focal point of teaching. Long enough has stress been laid on
the conditions in the world and what ought to be done. The
need now is for a prophet to say, "Thou art the man!"</p>

<p><b>39. Difficulties.</b></p>

<p>(1) <i>Pre-occupied soil.</i> "The cares of the world and the
deceitfulness of riches choke the word and it becomes unfruitful."</p>

<p>(2) <i>Fixedness of habit.</i> Life's attitude is settled in thought,
feeling, and will, and a change is possible only through the
Spirit who can make all things new.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The sin of idolatry.</i> Every life that has not put God first
now worships at the shrine of a self-elevated idol, the tangible
expression of its ideal. To dethrone it from love and substitute
Jesus Christ shakes to the foundations.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Weakness of spiritual aspirations.</i> It is a law of the
feelings that repression instead of expression weakens a feeling
and tends to its destruction. If the life has refused to act upon
its impulses toward God through the years, the task of making
the feeling strong enough to lead into action now is one beyond
the power of the teacher. It must be done by God, who "is
able to raise up even from the dead."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p><b>40. Results to be Expected.</b>&mdash;As life nears its meridian
and the west grows clearer, it ought to be with unveiled face
and character changing into His likeness in beauty, love, and
self-surrendered service.</p>

<h3>Lesson 1</h3>

<h2>What the Teacher Should Be</h2>


<p><b>1. The Value of Character.</b>&mdash;We teach more by what we are than by what
we know. Emerson once said, "What you are thunders so loud I cannot
hear what you say." Everywhere the character of the teacher is counted
a vital part of his equipment. Even in secular schools the teacher is
required to possess a good moral character. How much more should we
demand high moral and spiritual standards of the teacher in the
Sunday-school! But mere goodness is not enough. We must demand, in
addition to personal worth, certain other salient qualities in the
person who stands before childhood as a teacher of God's truth.</p>

<p><b>2. Training Always Needed.</b>&mdash;There is a common notion
that teachers like poets are born, not made. This is fallacious
for two reasons: (a) we do not know till we try whether or not
we can teach; (b) we do know now that the greater number of
teachers are made by training and not by inherited qualities.
Then, too, we are told that born teachers need no training, that
they can teach without preparation. This notion is false,
because the best native power may be made better by proper
training. We call a doctor who has had no training in medicine
a "quack," and it is not too much to say the same of untrained
teachers. Hence all of us will be the better fitted for our work
in the Sunday-school if we have in addition to our native powers
such added power as prayer and training assuredly give.</p>

<p><b>3. A Living Example.</b>&mdash;The teacher should be not only a
professing Christian, but a living example of the kind of life we
want every child to live. It is unfortunate to place the destiny
of a human soul in the care and under the directing thought of
a teacher who neither believes nor lives a consistent Christian
life. The teacher should be <i>kindly considerate</i> of his pupils[.]
No amount of fine teaching power can compensate for the lack
of such kindly concern for the welfare of his pupils as will best
lead them to crave in their own lives the same courteous and
considerate qualities. He should also be perfectly <i>sincere</i> and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
<i>frank</i>. There can be no such thing as "playing a part" in the
presence of children. They discern with an intuition that is
as certain as logic the sincerity or insincerity of the teacher.
It is a mistake to flatter, to scold, to threaten or to cajole pupils.
These are the marks of poor teaching. A perfectly frank teacher
will never cheapen his sacred opportunity by any trick or device
that has the ring of insincerity.</p>

<p><b>4. Enthusiasm.</b>&mdash;The teacher should be an <i>enthusiast</i>. I
had the good fortune to hear Bishop Phillips Brooks speak to a
great body of men in Boston. There was in his whole manner
such sincerity and enthusiasm as to carry conviction to each one
in his audience. He had a good thing. He believed in it with
his whole heart. He was enthusiastic in its praise. He had
tested it and found it good. He wanted others to share the same
splendid good. His address left an impression that years cannot
dim. His enthusiasm made him a great teacher. This does
not mean that one should speak in a loud tone, in high-pitched
voice, with vehement manner and gesture. These are marks
of weakness, not of strength. But it does mean that one should
be confident of the worth of his message and anxious to impress
its worth upon others. Enthusiasm is born of sincere conviction
in the correctness of the thing one aims to teach.</p>

<p><b>5. Directness.</b>&mdash;Much of all that is best in teaching is the
result of a mastery of the theme in such way as to make all the
statements and questions of the teacher <i>clear and direct</i>. One
must consider his language carefully. To the child in the class
words may mean quite a different thing from what they mean
to the teacher. One must have the pupils' point of view, and
then make all his teaching so pointed, so specific, that the
meaning must be clear.</p>

<p><b>6. Alert Insight.</b>&mdash;The teacher must be <i>alert</i> and <i>aggressive</i>,
discerning the favorable moment to say great truths; with his
thoughts more upon his pupils than upon his text. Otherwise
his power to govern is weakened and the interest of his
pupils is lessened if not wholly lost. To accomplish the best
things one must know in advance the scope and purpose of the
lesson, and watch for the moment when, with interest at its
height, he will best succeed in reaching the deepest fountains of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
purpose in the soul of the pupil. This quality of insight in the
teacher's equipment will put the class upon a basis of work.
The pupils will quickly realize that the teacher is imbued with a
purpose; that he proceeds in a business-like way to accomplish a
result which is seen to be of value. The very directness of the
teacher is an asset of great significance. This always appeals to
young persons. They like a lesson that is full of snap and action.
They will not long abide a dull and dreary dragging over a subject&mdash;be
it ever so fruitful in guidance.</p>

<p><b>7. Love.</b>&mdash;The teacher must be a sincere <i>lover of childhood</i>
and <i>of the Master</i>. In the final chapter of the great Gospel by
John, Jesus examines Peter and indicates the basis of great
teaching power. It is well to study this narrative carefully.
Picture Peter, at the dawn, weary and disheartened, coming
from his fishless quest. The Master meets him and asks him
but one question, but he asks that question three times, and
each time he follows Peter's reply with the command "Feed."
The lesson is plain&mdash;he that loves most feeds best, and the
measure of one's power to teach the truth of God to his children
is the measure of one's love for the Master Teacher. Where
there is no love there can be no great teaching.</p>

<h3>Lesson 2</h3>

<h2>What the Teacher Should Know</h2>


<p><b>8. He Must Have, before He Can Give.</b>&mdash;We can give only
what we possess. This law holds throughout. Peter understood
this when he made the memorable reply to the beggar's request
for alms: "Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give
I thee." It follows that whatever we wish the pupil to know
the teacher should also know, and he should know more than he
can hope to teach.</p>

<p><b>9. He Should Know His Bible.</b>&mdash;What do we wish the pupil to learn?
Answering this will answer in part the question, What should the
teacher know? Manifestly, then, the teacher should be familiar with
the Bible. How very fragmentary and unsatisfactory our knowledge of
the great Book is until we have studied it in a definite and
systematic way&mdash;in the way we study our history or our geography. The
teacher should at least know the salient features of the incomparable
Text and should have well fixed in memory many of the great utterances
that lie like flecks of gold upon its sunny pages.</p>

<p><b>10. Clear and Related Knowledge.</b>&mdash;But the teacher should
know in a more connected and also in a more detailed way
the truths of the Book. The pupil's knowledge should be
<i>clear</i>, by which one means that he should know a thing and
not some other thing in its stead; and a teacher's knowledge
should be not only clear but <i>related</i>, by which one means that
he should know a thing in its relation to all other things with
which it is vitally connected. This makes for system in knowledge,
and gives the teacher the power to teach each fact with
its due emphasis, no more and no less. Some writers on education
call this kind of knowing <i>apperception</i>, by which they mean
seeing a thing in its proper system and in its due relations. To
say that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, that he lived in Nazareth,
that he was crucified on Calvary, and that he arose from the dead
on the third day, as he said he would, is clear knowledge. To see
Jesus as the fulfilment of prophecy, as the promised King, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
leader of his people, as a teacher with more than human insight,
as the founder of a church, and as the pattern and perfection of all
endeavor, is <i>related</i> knowledge; it is seeing Jesus as part of a great
system of purpose that swept into time by the will of God.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> It is well also for the teacher to possess <b>adequate</b> knowledge;
he should be able to separate a fact into its parts; that
is, analyze it. This analytic power makes for vivid teaching
but it is a power that the pupil in his early years cannot acquire.
Only the mature mind is analytic, and the teacher who knows
how to analyze a fact or a lesson knows the secret of proportion
in teaching, the power to know what to make emphatic, what
to make subordinate. It is a poor teacher who is unable to
distinguish between a vital element and a non-vital element.</p>

<p><b>12. Related Subjects.</b>&mdash;The teacher should also know such related
subjects as will best enable him to make clear each point under
treatment in the lesson. A teacher should have a working knowledge of
biblical geography and of sacred antiquities. He should know how to
use a concordance, how to work up cross-references, how to interpret
peculiar idioms, and in general how to use the text of the Bible in
the most effective manner. He should know the general principles of
organization pursued in a modern Sunday-school, together with the
outlines of the history of the church, and should have a general
knowledge of the translations of the Bible into the English language.</p>

<p><b>13. Thinking Principles.</b>&mdash;In addition to the subject-matter, the
teacher should know something of the laws of thought, and the best way
to use knowledge as an agency in <i>forming</i> these laws of thought. All
these laws are scheduled in any elementary treatise on psychology, and
the best method of using knowledge to train the soul is set forth in
any good treatise on pedagogy. Thus to a knowledge of the
subject-matter the teacher must add a knowledge of psychology and of
pedagogy. Scholarship alone is not the test of a good teacher.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> If one reflects for a time upon his own methods of acquiring
knowledge, he will begin to understand the operations of the human
soul. When one reads that knowledge enters the soul only through the
special senses, or that ideas may be recalled by memory, it is of the
utmost impor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>tance that he should ask himself the question: What do
these statements mean? An illustration will help to answer this
question: I know that fire will burn my hand; the knowledge of this
fact entered my consciousness through the sense of touch, and my
memory recalls it.</p>

<p><b>15. Teaching Principles.</b>&mdash;When the laws of soul growth
are fairly well understood, it is time to investigate the principles
of pedagogy, the laws that govern the teacher in the act of
using knowledge to occasion activity in the soul of a learner.
For the laws of teaching rest upon the laws of the soul. We
cannot know how to proceed in the teaching process until we
know how the soul acts under given conditions.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> This act of teaching is a vastly significant one. It results in
changing the viewpoint of the pupil's life. It should produce in his
soul new knowledge, or power, or skill, or all of these combined.
Consider well, teacher, what this means. How the child is taught
determines in no small way how he will in the years to come regard his
fellow-man, his country, his church, his own duty, and his loyalty to
all that makes for progress in the life that is hid with Christ in
God.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> There are certain educational principles of great value to
the teacher. Consider what it means to adapt knowledge to
the capacity of the learner, or what it means to secure interest
in the learner, or what it means to proceed from the simple to
the complex in teaching, and you will begin to understand
something of the power of right activities in the recitation.</p>

<h3>Lesson 3</h3>

<h2>What the Teacher Should Do</h2>


<p><b>18.</b> The teacher must have a <b>purpose</b>, must see the end of the
teaching process, and the way to that end. Then he should
endeavor in the best way to reach that goal. The goal is to
<i>achieve in the pupil the highest type of religious conduct</i>: not
a religious feeling nor a religious thought system; but feeling
and thought crystallized into character, the standard coin of
the soul. All the efforts of the teacher must be directed to the
attainment of this purpose. Otherwise the recitation will be
aimless and the result failure.</p>

<p><b>19.</b> The teacher must have a <b>plan</b> of procedure in advance of
the recitation. This plan he should map out carefully, and then
on his knees ask God if it is the best plan. To plan carefully
and then to execute skilfully is the prime test of teaching. This
plan must include a study of each pupil as well as a study of
each lesson. It is at this point that so many teachers go wrong.
They seem to think that a knowledge of the lesson is the only
preparation required. They overlook the fact that it is vastly
more important <i>to know the pupil than it is to know the lesson</i>.
Those that know the subject-matter only are scholars, not
teachers. Those that add to their knowledge of the subject-matter
a clear insight into the operations of their pupils' minds
and also comprehend the fine art of fitting knowledge to the
capacity of the learner, are the only real teachers.</p>

<p><b>20.</b> The teacher must be <b>ready to change his plan</b> if it does
not meet the conditions that arise in the class; but this is a
critical procedure, and only the wise teacher may follow it with
success. The teacher must not allow pupils to lead him into
by-paths. Here tact and skill are of use in leading the class to
the teacher's will and to the teacher's plan. The teacher's will
must be supreme in it all. I have seen great opportunities lost
absolutely because a weak teacher allowed the lesson to drift
at the caprice of a pupil instead of following a well-conceived plan.
A group of boys once told me that they did not need to prepare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
the Sunday-school lesson because they always asked the teacher
some questions at the opening of the recitation, and the teacher
took the entire time to discuss the questions. The pupils, the
while, sat in their places smiling at the weakness of a teacher who
lacked the discernment necessary to be master of the situation.
The time given to the legitimate work of instruction is all too
brief to be wasted in any such senseless ways.</p>

<p><b>21.</b> The teacher must be alert and <b>lead the recitation</b>. This
quality of leadership challenges interest and carries the pupil
with a sweep of enthusiasm to the end. To lead most wisely is
so to direct the current of thought as if it were not directed. The
highest art in teaching is to conceal that art, to guide by suggestion
and not by command.</p>

<p><b>22.</b> The teacher will strive to secure a major part of the <b>discussion
from the pupil</b>. He will know when not to talk. It must not be
forgotten that it is the thing the teacher causes the pupil to do, not
the thing the teacher does in the presence of the pupil, that is most
significant. Many a class is talked into mental stupor and spiritual
indifference. A garrulous teacher is an abomination.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> A wise teacher will <b>work for his pupils</b>. His aim will be steadily
to aid them out of class as well as in class. I know a teacher who
meets his class occasionally for a social hour in an informal way. The
boys of that class are enthusiastic believers in their teacher and in
the power of practical Christian fellowship. Look into the Elder
Brother movement, the value of an organized class, and kindred
movements that give the teacher the power to direct conduct in the
pupil. Here you will find the key to many successful avenues of
usefulness to the pupil. The significance of all this lies in the
general value of a teacher who by word and by deed makes easy the way
of the pupil to the Master.</p>

<p><b>24.</b> A good teacher will know when <b>to commend</b> and when
not to commend. He will not open himself to the criticism that
his praise is overdue; nor will he, on the other hand, constantly
scold and complain and nag his pupils. He will insist upon
order and industry and will labor assiduously to arouse enthusiasm
in the class. He will constantly endeavor to see things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
from the pupils' point of view and sympathize with the pupils'
plan of thought. He will not forget that he was once a child,
and he will steadily pray for that wise charity that knows the
difference between childish caprice and youthful viciousness.
He will not seriously regard the former; he will not fail to check
and rebuke the latter.</p>

<p><b>25.</b> A wise teacher will <b>aim at a few things</b> and bend his
energies to achieve them. He will not dissipate his power by
undertaking to do too many things. He will fix upon some dominant
purpose and cause it to run like a thread of gold throughout
the recitation. I once heard a preacher begin his discourse with
the Garden of Eden and end it with the New Jerusalem. He
said so many things in an unrelated way that his effort was
wholly wasted. It is a mark of weakness to engage in mental
sauntering. The wise teacher will hold a thought before his
pupils until, like a jewel, it flashes light from every facet. He
will also use the best things done by some one pupil to stimulate
like results in others. Above all, a consecrated teacher will
not grow weary in well doing, for he should have an unflinching
faith in God, in his pupil, and in the power of his teaching to
produce Christian character.</p>

<h3>Lesson 4</h3>

<h2>What the Pupil Should Do</h2>


<p><b>26. The Pupil's Part.</b>&mdash;The part the pupil takes in the act
of learning is all-important. The success of the recitation is
in a large degree conditioned by the attitude of the pupil. He
must be organized and directed by the teacher for the process
of instruction. What the pupil will do in the recitation is conditioned
upon the skill and power of the teacher. When the pupil
fails to do what he should do the fault usually lies with the teacher.
The pupil does that which the teacher stimulates him to do.</p>

<p><b>27.</b> The pupil should approach the recitation <i>willingly and
gladly</i>. The pupil who is in class against his will is a difficult
pupil to teach, and it is doubtful whether or not any lasting good
results from enforced attendance. Parents should not overlook
this fact, and teachers will find here a hint of unusual significance.
This willing, joyous approach to the lesson is conditioned upon
at least four things: (a) the preparation of the lesson by the
pupil in advance; (b) the absence of other appeals more enticing
to the interest of the pupils; (c) the quality of teaching power
and skill exercised by the teacher; (d) the spirit of good-will
and of kindly concern that rules the school as a whole.</p>

<p><b>28. The Pupil's Preparation.</b>&mdash;From the smaller pupils no formal
preparation can be demanded in advance. But for all, the lesson should
be read, either by the pupil or by some one in the home, prior to the
time of the recitation. It is a good plan to indicate briefly the week
preceding just what leading ideas and incidents the pupils should
master before the recitation occurs. There are many indirect acts that
the pupil may perform during the week that may fittingly be regarded
as preparation for the lesson; such as visits to the sick, efforts to
bring new members to the class, incidents of the week which made a
marked impression for good, and kindred matters. These can all be
touched upon by the teacher by judicious questioning, and in this way,
at the opening of the recitation, lead each pupil to make some
statement of a good done. This will promote the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> moral atmosphere so
vital to successful interpretation of the lesson.</p>

<p><b>29. Divided Interests.</b>&mdash;Many times the pupil comes reluctantly
to the Sunday-school because his interests lie for that hour
elsewhere. If the parents go on a pleasure trip, it is unfair to
compel the child to forfeit the same opportunity. Wise parents
will show the more excellent way by themselves accompanying
their children to the Sunday-school. My own father never led
his boys to the silent recesses of the mountain brooks to see
God's wonder world until after we had returned from the
Sunday-school. To enjoy the former we were unconsciously
encouraged to attend the latter. The so-called "liberal" Sabbath
is the foe of the Sunday-school, and all friends of the best
things should oppose the lessening of the power that wins childhood
for the Master through regular attendance upon his school.</p>

<p><b>30.</b> When pupils dislike the teacher because he is weak or rude or
petulant or unprepared to teach, it is difficult to keep these pupils
in regular attendance. Each teacher should constantly ask himself, How
may I personally add to the attractiveness of the Sunday-school?
Careful inquiry and close supervision of the classes by the
superintendent should compel good teaching or a prompt change of
teachers. It is useless to expect pupils to love the Sunday-school
well enough to endure a worthless teacher. How often pupils grow weary
in attendance because the teacher has no power to woo the young spirit
to the fountains of love and light! On the other hand, how gladly and
how regularly children turn to the Sunday-school when a great-hearted
and warm-spirited teacher is always there to welcome and to nourish
them!</p>

<p><b>31.</b> There is a marvelous attractive power in a well-organized
school. When the spirit that rules in it and the organization that
guides it are so wisely fostered as to create in the school an atmosphere
of genuine stimulation the pupil will find it easy to come
gladly, to say with the Psalmist, "I was glad when they said
unto me, let us go unto the house of Jehovah."</p>

<p><b>32. Reverence.</b>&mdash;In the recitation proper, the pupil should be helped
to be reverent, well-behaved, and actively absorbed in the lesson. He
should be shown the gains of complying promptly and cheerfully with
the requests of his teacher; the King's busi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>ness must be conducted
with decency and dispatch. He should develop a quickening concern for
the welfare of his classmates and foster a wholesome support to the
class as an organization. It is not always the lesson taught but the
spirit that rules during the lesson that wins the young spirit to
adoration and service.</p>

<p><b>33. Regularity and Promptness.</b>&mdash;The early acquisition of
the habits of regularity and promptness in attendance are virtues
of no mean moment in the life of the learner. Whatever may be
legitimately done to promote these habits is worthily done.
An essential part of the discipline of life lies in acquiring dependable
habits. It is the systematic attendance upon the Sunday-school
that at last leads the pupil to say again, "I was glad when
they said unto me, Let us go unto the house of Jehovah." Some
unique and valuable exercise at the opening of the recitation,
occupying but a minute or two of time, will often prove of
great value. I have headed this chapter, "What the pupil should
do," because it is not what the pupil thinks, nor what he says,
that is of greatest moment. It is his conduct in the class and
his conduct during the week in home, in school, in play, that
tests most directly the value of the teaching he receives. The
focus of teacher concern is not what the pupil learns, but what
the pupil does; not thought, but conduct; not theory, but practise;
not ideas, but acts; not ability to answer questions, but
ability to live a clean, sweet, quiet Christian life. All teaching
that falls short of this goal is unworthy teaching. The supreme
test of teaching, laid down by the Master, is that we should do
the will of our Father that is in heaven.</p>

<h3>Lesson 5</h3>

<h2>What Teaching Is</h2>


<p><b>34. Teaching Defined.</b>&mdash;The Sunday-school teacher as much
as any other teacher should understand clearly what teaching is.
Teaching is not telling, and no amount of talking to the pupil
can be considered as teaching. Teaching is not determined by
anything that happens outside the pupil, but by the action of
the pupil's soul upon the things that are presented to it through
the senses. <i>Teaching may be defined as causing a human soul
to know.</i></p>

<p><b>35.</b> Everything outside the learner may be considered his
teacher. We are taught in the broadest sense by the spirit of
God's universe expressed in terms of order and law. We are
taught in a more restricted sense by our immediate environment,
and especially by the people whose lives come in close contact
with our own. In the most restricted sense we are taught by a
trained mind, and this trained mind belongs to a person called
a teacher. The process of teaching may be considered as the
act of bringing into the consciousness of the learner the knowledge
already in the consciousness of the teacher. We cannot teach
what we do not know. Teaching ends when the pupil knows
all that the teacher knows.</p>

<p><b>36. Impression and Expression.</b>&mdash;When I say that I know a
certain thing, I mean that my soul possesses that thing and
knows that it possesses it; this is <i>consciousness</i>. The teaching
act completes itself when the learner is able to express in language
or otherwise to the satisfaction of the teacher the facts
in consciousness. In other words, the soul is not fully educated
until it has reached the point of expression.</p>

<p><b>37.</b> It will be seen from this that teaching is possible only when
the soul is actively seeking new knowledge. This attempt of the
soul to seek new knowledge causes it, for one reason or another,
to focus itself upon some one object of thought to the exclusion
of all other objects of thought. <i>This act is called attention.</i>
When the will directs the attention it is called <i>voluntary</i> atten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>tion.
When some other agency than the will directs the attention
it is called <i>involuntary</i> attention.</p>

<p><b>38. Securing Attention.</b>&mdash;The greatest art in teaching is to secure
attention. The highest form of attention is voluntary attention. The
young child does not possess sufficient will-power to control
attention; consequently in the early grades some other agent than a
command of the will must hold attention. This other agent in a general
way may be characterized as <i>interest</i>. In other words, the young
child's interests hold his attention, and the thing in which he takes
the greatest interest will easiest attract his attention.</p>

<p><b>39.</b> There are certain well-known principles underlying the
interest of the child. First, his curiosity; second, novelty, or
unexpectedness; third, imitativeness; fourth, illustrations based
upon his experience. The teacher cannot be too careful to
consider what is of interest to a child. We cannot measure the
interests of a child by the interests of an adult. Here the
study of child nature is the only safe and adequate guidance.</p>

<p><b>40. How Knowledge Reaches the Soul.</b>&mdash;There are but five gateways to
the soul of a child, called the senses:&mdash;Seeing, hearing, touching,
tasting, smelling. There are no other channels of approach. Whatever
increases the breadth of this sense-approach in a subject of study
increases the interest of the learner in that subject. If I tell a
child about a <i>ball</i>, I utilize his sense of hearing; if I show him a
ball, at the same time I describe it, I utilize seeing and hearing; if
I hand him a ball, as I describe it, I utilize touching, seeing, and
hearing. A single fact reaching consciousness through the senses and
recognized in consciousness is called a percept or a particular
notion. It is sometimes called an idea. The soul in giving expression
to an idea uses a word or some other sign for the idea. Thus words are
the signs of ideas.</p>

<p><b>41.</b> When other facts of a similar character reach consciousness, and
are identified there with the first percept, the percept becomes a
concept, general notion or general idea, just as the percept is an
individual idea; that is, the percept stands for one object
apprehended in consciousness; the concept stands for a group of
similar objects under one name apprehended in con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>sciousness. All the
common nouns are concepts just as all proper nouns are percepts. For
example, in the sentence, "Washington was a brave man," it is plain
that "Washington" is a particular idea or percept and "man" is a
general idea or concept.</p>

<p><b>42. Judgment and Reasoning.</b>&mdash;The aim of the teacher is,
first, to secure clear percepts, and then rapidly to change these
percepts into concepts, which is only another way of saying that
good teaching relates the things in the soul in such a way as to
give the child the fewest possible terms with which to carry the
largest possible number of particular facts. Concepts are the
shorthand of the soul's language. When these concepts are
compared and their agreement or disagreement noted the soul
is forming judgments. When these judgments are expressed
in language the soul is forming sentences. When these judgments
are compared and their agreement or disagreement noted,
the soul is reasoning. Sentences are the signs of judgments
or reasons, just as words are the signs of percepts or concepts.
Thus the percept first comes; the percept grows into the concept;
the concept into the judgment; the judgment into reasoning;
and these are the four steps in the process of knowing.
They are the tools of thought. Teaching must be a training in
the use of these tools.</p>

<p><b>43. Memory</b> is of little use unless it is simply the power
to hold things clearly understood by the soul. It is not good
teaching to burden the memory with masses of things not clearly
perceived and conceived, although it may be at the beginning
not at all objectionable to commit to memory certain great
utterances from the Bible and other standard literature, even
when the meaning is not clearly and fully apprehended. But
at the earliest time possible these should be analyzed and the
meaning worked into forms of clear knowledge.</p>

<p><b>44. Imagination.</b>&mdash;Imagination is the power of the soul to work up into
new combinations the things in memory. Memory keeps things as the soul
got them through the senses. The products of memory have a basis in
experience. The products of imagination have no such basis in
experience. Imagination is the creator of new products. It cares not
for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> facts, but works after its own fancy. It is a more dangerous
power because more free. To curb it at the outset is necessary. To
allow it free range is to open the way for statements from the child
that often alarm the parent or teacher. But when once the moral sense
is awakened and governs imagination the latter becomes the agency that
creates all art and enriches all life.</p>

<p><b>45.</b> Teaching aims to develop by appropriate exercise all
these powers of the soul. What the pupil learns is not so important
as what power he gains in the control and use of his thinking
processes under the guidance of a skilful teacher.</p>

<h3>Lesson 6</h3>

<h2>What an Educational Principle Is</h2>


<p><b>46. Laws of the Soul.</b>&mdash;Everything in this world behaves in a certain
way under certain conditions. All the things in God's great, good
world operate in harmony with some force or power that is always
present and that always does or causes to be done the same thing. When
once we have discovered this power and stated in a formula how it
behaves we have a law. The soul is no exception to this general
statement. It behaves, under similar conditions, in the same way. When
once we have discovered how the soul acts and formulate its methods of
action we have a law of the soul.</p>

<p><b>47.</b> From these laws of the soul we may also learn how to make
the soul grow in a certain desired way. We can also discover
the laws in the materials which we use to cause growth in the
soul. These laws become the guide to all good teaching. They
are here called educational laws or principles.</p>

<p><b>48. Educational Principles.</b>&mdash;Thus it will be seen that educational
principles rest upon the laws of the soul. They tell us in
brief and clear statements what should govern us in teaching a
growing soul. If one turns to any treatise on pedagogy he will
find there a statement of these laws. Of course, these will be
found to vary somewhat because no one is quite certain that the
last facts concerning the soul are known.</p>

<p><b>49.</b> But the important thing is not, after all, what one finds
in the books, but what one is finally led to accept as his own
guiding principles. It is of the utmost importance that one
should have certain general principles of education as standards
by which to test his own teaching. A ship without a compass
sails a no less aimless or dangerous course than does a teacher
without pedagogic guidance. What the compass is to the ship,
educational principles are to the teacher. Thus educational
principles aid in achieving the end or purpose of the educational
process; which end is, according to Spencer, "to live completely,"
or, as we usually say, to fit each one to live in the exercise of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the power God made it possible for him to enjoy. To realize
this end teaching must proceed according to law.</p>

<p><b>50.</b> The first law to be noted is that <b>the subject matter presented to
a growing soul must be adapted to the capacity of the learner</b>. This
law is so self-evident that we unconsciously observe it. We do not
give the same kind of lessons to a child in the primary grade that we
should and do give to the pupil in the adult Bible class. The whole
significance of graded exercises is based upon this fundamental
principle. This law rests upon the generally accepted fact that the
different powers of the soul change their relative activity during the
years of growth.</p>

<p><b>51.</b> The second principle is equally important: <b>There is a
natural order in which the powers of the soul should be
exercised.</b> This order is the order of their activity. The
earliest power to become educationally active is sensation, the
last is reason, and hence we can phrase this law in the maxim
"from sense to reason." Different writers state the same thing
in the following way: observation before reasoning; the concrete
before the abstract; sense knowledge before thought knowledge;
facts before definitions; processes before rules; the particular
before the general; the simple before the complex; from the known
to the next related unknown. All these maxims may be traced
to the same law of the soul, and they may all be summed up in
the maxim, <i>teaching must proceed from things to symbols</i>, since
the senses deal with things and reason deals with symbols. No
wise teacher will pass this law by until its full significance is
understood. Jesus was a masterful teacher. He observed this
law frequently. Note the examples in the Gospels, using the
incident at Jacob's well as an example. &AElig;sop's fables are all
built upon the principle here laid down, as are the numerous
fairy tales by the Grimms, Andersen, and others.</p>

<p><b>52.</b> Since the soul grows only by its own activity a third law arises:
<b>Knowledge can be acquired only by occasioning the proper activity in
the soul of the pupil.</b> It is always important to keep in mind that it
is not what the teacher thinks and does, but what he causes the pupil
to think and do, that makes for knowledge. The best teaching secures
the best mental activity on the part of the pupil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p><b>53.</b> Just what the proper activity is may be seen by a consideration of
a fourth principle: <b>First presentations of new knowledge must be made
objectively in all grades of the school.</b> Ideas cannot be taught
through words. They can be taught through objects, and the ideas can
then be named. The name is the word. This law may be stated as "ideas
before words." It stands as a protest against abstract and formal
teaching. It demands that knowledge shall be fitted to the nature of
the soul's growth. The child that for the first time was shown a
growing fern in a vase and called it "a pot of green feathers" was on
the right track. He will in due time acquire the right word. His idea
is clear. It follows also that <i>the only words in which knowledge can
be presented to the soul are words that name known things</i>.</p>

<p><b>54.</b> These and many other principles are the basis of the whole
teaching process. Happy that child whose teacher has thought his way
through these essential laws and observes them in all the activities
of the recitation. No teacher can grow in power or skill without
mastering the meaning of these laws, which may be called the alphabet
of the teacher's preparation. These laws the teacher should always
have in mind as guidance. They are not to be announced to the pupil.
Jesus always followed great educational principles, but he never
announced these to his disciples. When you say "That is a good
lesson," you mean that the lesson is in harmony with laws of teaching
you know to be good. There is no other basis of judging the worth of a
teacher.</p>

<h3>Lesson 7</h3>

<h2>What an Educational Method Is</h2>


<p><b>55. Applying Principles.</b>&mdash;When the teacher puts an educational
principle to work in the act of teaching he uses a method.
A method is a principle applied, put into operation. Principles
make up one's educational theory; methods make up one's
educational practise. It is as important to have a good method
as it is to have a good law. The way a law is applied is a
method. When we agreed that it would be a good thing to
teach scientific temperance to our children we announced a principle.
To apply this led to the use of the school. Teaching in
the school the subject of scientific temperance became a method.
We might have chosen the home, the church, or any other agency.</p>

<p><b>56.</b> One's method is often the test of one's principle. If I say
that repetition makes for clear knowledge I announce a law or
principle. The test of the law is the way the soul acts under
repetition. Does the learner gain in clearness of knowledge by
repetition? If so, the law is true. If not, the law is not true.</p>

<p><b>57. Kinds of Methods.</b>&mdash;Methods are of two kinds: <i>general</i>
and <i>special</i>. A general method may be followed in teaching all
the different subjects that make up a course of study. A special
method is followed in teaching one particular subject or a part
of a subject. A device is merely a temporary resort to some
special act to accomplish an immediate result. Methods, general
and special, may be used again and again. A device rarely can
be repeated, since the same conditions may never again arise.</p>

<p><b>58. Analytic and Synthetic Method.</b>&mdash;A lesson, like a jack-knife, is
made up of a number of parts. We may begin the recitation by
presenting first the object or lesson as a whole and follow with a
study of the parts; this is the <i>analytic method</i>. Or we may begin the
recitation by presenting first the parts, one at a time, and follow
with a study of the object as a whole. This is the <i>synthetic method</i>
in teaching. These two general methods are usually combined in a
complete lesson. That is to say, we usually consider first the whole
thought, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> analyze it into its several parts, and when each part
is understood, we combine by synthesis the parts into the general
thought. If, for example, we begin by citing the golden text, and then
analyze the lesson to find the parts that illustrate the meaning in
the golden text, and finally combine these parts into a fuller
understanding of the golden text, the process is analytico-synthetic.
The purpose of this thought exercise is to enlarge the learner's
comprehension of the general truth in the lesson. In the earlier years
teaching should be largely synthetic; in later years, analytic. A
study of the growth of the powers of the soul will show why this is
so.</p>

<p><b>59. Inductive and Deductive Method.</b>&mdash;When once the
mind is trained to analyze fairly well it is possible to use another
set of general methods. In reasoning we may begin with particular
facts, with simple sensations, with the individual notions
based upon concrete experience, and rise step by step to a general
law. If we pursue this plan in the recitation, we use the <i>inductive
method</i> in teaching. If we pursue the opposite order, beginning
with some general law or principle and proceed by reasoning to
special or particular facts, we use the <i>deductive method</i> in teaching.
The parable of the sower is a good example of inductive teaching.
The seventh chapter of Matthew contains a number of excellent
examples of deductive teaching. Note carefully the method by
which Jesus makes plain the words, "Beware of false prophets."
These general methods are followed always in one order or
another by every good teacher.</p>

<p><b>60.</b> The recitation also affords opportunity for the exercise of
special methods. We may or we may not ask <i>questions</i>. We
may or we may not assign <i>topics</i>, we may or we may not draw
<i>pictures</i> on a blackboard. We may or we may not ask pupils to
<i>consult the text</i> of the lesson in reciting the same. These facts
suggest methods that the wise teacher will consider carefully.</p>

<p><b>61. Questioning.</b>&mdash;If the teacher asks and requires the pupils to
answer a series of questions he is using the <i>question method</i>. It is
a good method because it compels the pupils to think and to give
expression in proper language to their thoughts. It is vastly better
than telling, for telling things to pupils is not teaching, since it
fails to cause the pupil's mind to act in any creative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> way. It is a
much abused method because many questions that an unwise teacher asks
do not lead by synthesis to a common general truth or law. It is to be
noted that the simplest form of questioning seeks only to obtain in
answer a statement of fact, as when one asks how many miles it is from
Jerusalem to Jericho, or who betrayed Jesus, or any similar question
that calls for a statement of fact. A better question is one that sets
all the currents of thought aflow, that causes one to stop, think,
weigh, ponder, deliberate, before framing an answer. A careful study
of Jesus' method of asking questions is of the utmost value in
mastering the fine art of teaching by the question method. In Luke 9
Jesus asks the question, "Who do the multitudes say that I am?" After
the disciples had reported all the guesses of the people, he asked,
"But who say ye that I am?" This question went to the heart of the
subject of his identity. It forced from Peter a great declaration.
Wise questioning always touches the very center of discussion and
crystallizes thought.</p>

<p><b>62.</b> For more advanced classes it is a good plan to assign in
advance certain subjects to be recited by the pupil in the recitation.
When this is done, the teacher uses the <i>topical method</i>.
It requires a maximum of effort and should not be used with
young pupils. It is an excellent method in the Bible classes.</p>

<p><b>63. Illustrations.</b>&mdash;If the teacher uses objects, pictures, or
drawings to make meaningful his language in teaching, he is
using the <i>illustrated method</i>. This is especially valuable in the
primary grades. The one necessary caution is that the objects,
pictures, or drawings shall be wisely selected, and that in their use
special care be taken that the interest of the pupils is focused upon
the thought or fact to be taught and not upon the illustration.</p>

<p><b>64.</b> If the teacher allows the pupils to consult the text while
reciting, his method is likely to produce little permanent good.
To fix the lesson in memory, to lay aside all books, to face the
anxious and earnest teacher, is to secure the best results. Of
course, there are times when the text is to be studied and when
it is necessary to refer to the printed lesson, but a wise teacher
will remember that when soul looks into soul the greatest possible
good comes from teaching.</p>

<h3>Lesson 8</h3>

<h2>What the Concrete Means in Teaching</h2>


<p><b>65. Value of the Concrete.</b>&mdash;The world is made up of concrete
things; that is, things which can be recognized by the senses.
The first impressions the soul gets of this world are concrete.
We call them individual or perceptual notions. The soul compares,
classifies, generalizes these concrete notions into general
or conceptual notions. These thought products are abstract.
But all knowledge begins in these individual notions and hence
all first presentations of a new lesson or a new object of thought
must be in the concrete. The richer and more varied the concrete
data, the more valuable is the mental result in abstract
thought. When an abstract notion is presented to a class it is
of no educational value unless it can be referred back in the mind
of each pupil to some concrete experience in his own past. The
teacher, knowing this, will always aim to interpret general truths,
which are abstract, into terms of experience, which are concrete.
When David wishes to express the thirst of his soul for God he
says, "As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth
my soul after thee, O God." To a people familiar with Palestine
and the habits of the hart this language at once made vividly
real, in a concrete image, the great longing the pure soul has for
its Creator.</p>

<p><b>66.</b> All the tentacles of the soul seem to find in the concrete
thing great sources of nourishment. Note the crowds that throng
the zo&ouml;logical gardens, the flower expositions, the picture galleries,
the museums of one sort or another, to see the potency of
the concrete as a great teaching power. Explore a boy's pocket to
learn what the concrete is worth. Why all these "scraps,"
broken glass, rusty nails, old knives, buttons, peculiar pebbles,
colored strings, parts of a watch or clock, odd sticks, bits of chewing
gum, ends of pencils, broken buckles, speckled beans, colored
papers, bits of fur, and other things that he treasures? Because
in a most potential way they are nutrition to his yearning soul.
One will never fathom the real depths of the concrete as teaching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
data until he can appreciate why the son of a President of the
United States gladly traded rare exotic flowers from the White
House conservatory for the discarded paper caps of common
milk bottles.</p>

<p><b>67.</b> The trouble we all experience is to discover just what concrete
thing the general statement figures in the soul of the child.
When our pupils read</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Up from the meadows rich with corn,<br />
Clear in the cool September morn,"<br />
</p></div>

<p>what does it mean to them? Instance a poor child whose life
is pent within the narrow walls of a city tenement, one who has
never seen the park, much less the great, grand farms of the
country; what can even this simple language of Whittier's figure
to that child? Do you not see that first of all the needed thing
in teaching is to bring new thoughts into terms of old thoughts,
to interpret the new by the old, to translate all abstract truth
into terms of conduct and into terms of real concrete experience.
If then the pupil's personal experience is meager, how very difficult
it is to teach him, and how very important it is that we
should be wise enough to supply the concrete data necessary to
make meaningful our teaching.</p>

<p><b>68. Tools for the Teacher.</b>&mdash;The agencies at the teacher's
disposal are objects, pictures, drawing, and stories. These
demand extended study. Do you have a collection of objects
and of pictures for teaching purposes? These are your tools.
Be sure you carry a goodly store of them. Select them with care
and use them with caution. If you cannot draw beautiful pictures,
do not worry. But be sure you can, with a few strokes of
the crayon, make concrete the thought you wish to emphasize.
This power is of immeasurable value and the training of every
teacher should include lessons in simple graphic illustration.</p>

<p><b>69. Stories.</b>&mdash;But above all else, as equipment to teach, can
you tell a story? The story is an abstract truth dressed in
concrete garments. When Jesus was asked to define the word
<i>neighbor</i> he might have answered in some such definition as may
be found in any dictionary. He was too wise a teacher to do
that. He immediately translated the meaning of neighbor into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
the concrete story of the good Samaritan and gave us an example
of the loftiest teaching power the world has ever known. Every
parable is an example of great skill in teaching the abstract by
means of the concrete. Go over the series and note in how many
ways the Kingdom of heaven is concreted into terms of the
common experience of the people Jesus taught.</p>

<p><b>70.</b> A good story, well told, at once attracts marked attention. The
pupil unconsciously turns to a concrete incident and from that obtains
the richest nutrition for his spirit. But the story must be well told.
It must contain abundant elements of specific detail and must be
packed with incidents that thrill with action. The old Mother Goose
rhymes are excellent examples of stories full of action, and, as a
result, of interest. The child personifies all things, that he may
find in them the elements of life, of action, of things in the process
of doing. If you will spend an hour with a boy who is riding a stick
that is to him a horse, or a girl who is playing with a rag-doll, you
will learn the method and value of action in the concrete materials of
instruction.</p>

<p><b>71. Rhyme and Song.</b>&mdash;If to the story is added the attractive
appeal of rhythm, rhyme, and song the concrete materials of
teaching become almost ideal. It is a good thing to conclude a
well-told story with a short, simple poem and a song, both of
which should relate to the same truth the story sets forth in the
concrete. Through story, rhyme, and song the growing soul
climbs most surely and securely to the lofty and illuminating
vistas of God's universal laws. Maxims, precepts, proverbs,
mottoes, laws, become meaningful and potential only when the
soul moulds these mass motives of guidance from the plastic and
suggestive data of a rich and varied contact with concrete experiences
and things. "I am the vine," "I am the good shepherd," "I
am the way," contain the very essence of all great method in the
art of building a soul for the Kingdom of God and of service.</p>

<h3>Lesson 9</h3>

<h2>What Instruction, Drill, and Examination Can Do</h2>


<p><b>72.</b> The two processes at work in every good recitation are
<b>teaching and learning</b>. The first of these processes is the work
of the teacher; the latter is the work of the pupil. Learning
includes study proper and practise in the use of knowledge
learned. The learning process should, of course, be directed by
the teacher.</p>

<p><b>73. Teaching</b>, the work of the teacher, includes three distinct
elements or parts: <i>instruction</i>, <i>drill</i>, <i>examination</i>. These
may at times be supplemented by a fourth teaching process of
considerable importance, <i>review</i>. Every good class exercise is
made up of these elements. In certain cases the amount of time
devoted to one or to the other of these varies greatly. No fixed
law can be set. The judgment of the teacher, the condition of
the class, the immediate purpose of the particular lesson, combine
to make the relative value of these elements vary from one
recitation to another. We can, however, study the purpose
or function of each and arrive at some fairly adequate guidance.</p>

<p><b>74. Instruction</b> is the process through which the teacher
aims to assist the pupil in the acquisition of knowledge or power,
or both. It may take the form of written or of oral instruction.
Written instruction has to do with the mastery of the printed
page. To know how to obtain knowledge from the printed page
is an important end of instruction. "Understandest thou what
thou readest?" is a question that goes to the heart of good written
instruction. Oral instruction is the act of the living teacher
in stimulating the pupil to know. It has three phases&mdash;<i>objective</i>,
<i>indirect</i>, and <i>direct</i>.</p>

<p><b>75.</b> <i>Objective instruction</i> is the presentation to the eye or
other sense of the pupil, by means of objects or pictures, some
concrete thing which will aid the pupil to gain clear knowledge.
We have already considered the value of this form of concrete
instruction.</p>

<p><b>76.</b> <i>Indirect instruction</i> is the process of recalling, through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
memory, past objective experiences and causing the mind to
discern their likeness or unlikeness, their relations one to another,
and to express a conclusion that the teacher does not first
announce. In indirect instruction the learner is led to express
his own past knowledge and, by comparing one fact with another,
to arrive for himself at new knowledge. This is a most difficult
but a most valuable type of instruction. It makes the pupil
an explorer after truth and it should result in making him a
discoverer of truth. The joy of original discovery possesses the
soul of the successful pupil, who is taught by this indirect or
suggestion method of instruction.</p>

<p><b>77.</b> <i>Direct instruction</i> is the communication of facts by the
teacher through oral language to the pupil. The pupil in this
type of learning follows the statements of the teacher and sees
for himself the truth of the facts presented and the conclusion
reached. The danger of direct teaching lies in the fact that the
teacher may fail to arouse in the pupil a current of thought corresponding
to his own. In this case there is no resulting knowledge
in the soul of the learner; and, instead, there is likely to be
confusion or disorder in the class. This is a common phenomenon
in classes that are so unfortunate as to have poor teachers. The
law underlying all oral teaching is as follows: <i>Do not tell the
pupil directly what he may be reasonably expected to observe or
discern for himself.</i></p>

<p><b>78. Drill</b> is the process through which the teacher aims to assist the
pupil in the acquisition of power and skill. The new truth, when first
apprehended by the pupil, must be made so familiar to the learner that
he can promptly and easily recall the new truth or knowledge. Drill is
the agency that accomplishes this result. Note how often a boy or girl
repeats some new sentence or word or game in order to fix its easy
recall. Many teachers think repetition deadens interest. But without
repetition Comenius rightly declares we do not know solidly.
Repetition is nature's way of developing strength. It is of prime
importance that every new truth be drilled until it is as familiar to
the learner as old knowledge. Then it becomes easy of recall and ready
for use. The wise teacher will avoid the abuse of the drill by so
varying the exercise as to secure a maximum of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> interest, for interest
is the basis of pleasure, and the soul does not easily retain
knowledge that is not pleasurable.</p>

<p><b>79. Examination</b> is the process through which the teacher
aims to test the result of instruction and learning. Its value is
twofold: it adds to the learner's knowledge by the preparation
he makes for the examination, and it gives the teacher a means
of measuring the results obtained through instruction and drill.
If the examination tests only knowledge gained by direct teaching,
it is of little value. If, on the contrary, the questions are so
phrased as to cause the pupil to think his way out of things
known into some newer and higher order of knowledge, it is a
valuable exercise. Usually before examinations are given the
teacher and pupils join in a <i>review</i>.</p>

<p><b>80.</b> The <b>review</b> is an invaluable teaching agency when it
results in such a reorganization of unrelated or partly related
facts of knowledge as to give the pupil a clearer and surer grasp
upon the relative value of the facts previously acquired. A
drill fixes a given fact more securely or solidly in the soul; a
review organizes these drilled facts into new systems and wider
classifications. It is seeing the old once more, but seeing it from
a new point of vantage; just as a man climbing a tower with
windows at stated points sees in each case all that he saw before,
but sees it in a new setting, sees it as part of a larger scene, and
sees it finally as a part of a mighty whole. Wisely conducted,
the review establishes proportion in the knowledge set in the
soul and leads finally and directly to the fact that all truth is at
last one truth; all life at last one life; all parts at last one great
infinite unity, whose name is God.</p>

<h3>Lesson 10</h3>

<h2>What Will-training Leads To</h2>


<p><b>81.</b> The soul by <b>thinking, feeling, and willing</b> completes
its round of activities. It is not a three-parted power, each part
doing one and only one of these things; but it is a single power,
capable of doing in turn all these things. The soul <i>thinking</i> is
at work in an intellectual process. The soul <i>feeling</i> is at work
in an emotional process. The soul <i>willing</i> is at work in a volitional
process. These three processes are so inter-related that
it is not easy to separate them at any given time, and yet a bit
of reflection upon how the soul does operate will make fairly
clear these distinct processes. A child that has not been made
unnatural by arbitrary training always follows its emotions and
its thoughts by action. The inference from this is significant.
The soul untrammeled always translates thought and feeling
into action. This is only another way of saying that all intellectual
and emotional products are under the direction of the will.
<i>The will is the power of the soul that resolves to do, that causes
us to act.</i> The will uses thought and feeling in much the same
way that a sailor uses compass and rudder to guide a vessel in
the right course.</p>

<p><b>82. The First Step, Obedience.</b>&mdash;At the beginning the feeling and
thought elements are so numerous and so complex that the will is
unable rightly to organize all this data into guidance. Hence the
child must be guided by a will that has, through experience, acquired
this power. The will of the parent and of the teacher is at the outset
the effective guide, and the one necessity for the welfare of the
child is obedience. Gradually the child finds his way through the maze
of things his intellect and his sensibilities have retained, and then
he becomes self-directive. His own will has asserted itself. He is now
able and should be free to direct his own actions. When he does this
his difficulties will not disappear. At times, he will find his will
at a loss to give the guidance he knows he should have. Then, by all
means, it is important that he should willingly surrender his finite
will to the infinite will, his imperfect guidance to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> perfect
guidance; and he shall thus find his complete freedom of action in
full surrender to the will of Almighty God.</p>

<p><b>83.</b> In this first stage, when parent and teacher are motive and will
to him, the child needs to be guided with the utmost care. <i>There must
be reasonableness in the guidance.</i> Caprice, anger, impatience,
arbitrariness, and severity are the methods of weaklings and cowards.
From all such the child should be freed. Consistency, kindness,
patience, reasonableness, and moderation are the methods of strong,
successful teachers. If you utter a command, see to it that the child
obeys. Nothing is quite so deadly in the realm of the will as the fact
that the pupil knows that his teacher threatens, commands, talks&mdash;but
never acts. If you really do not intend to enforce obedience, do not
utter the command. If you do not intend to compel obedience, do not
assume the r&ocirc;le of guide and teacher. How many children come into
caprice instead of regulated conduct because they have from infancy
lived in a realm of caprice, of confusion, and of disorder; a realm
that moved by no law and hence set no law of guidance in the soul of
the child.</p>

<p><b>84. The Aim of Teaching is Right Living.</b>&mdash;We err when we assume that
intellectual endeavor will inevitably lead to right conduct. Nothing
is more obvious than the fact that our conduct is far below the plane
of our thought. We <i>know</i> vastly better than we <i>do</i> the things that
are right and true. Nor do we quite understand the function of good
teaching if we neglect to cultivate the feeling powers of the soul. It
is my conviction that we act more nearly in harmony with our feelings
than our thoughts. If, then, conduct, right action, or character is
the end of all true teaching; if, as Jesus taught, it is not what we
know, nor yet what we feel, but what we do, that makes life worth
while, it is of the utmost importance that we should so train the
feeling life as well as the thought life as to prepossess the soul to
right conduct. But the feelings are intensely concrete. Whence arises
again the value of concrete teaching as a method in will training.</p>

<p><b>85. Self-control.</b>&mdash;Aim to bring the pupil speedily into the exercise
of his own will, into self-regulated conduct. Nothing will so surely
negative good instruction as to deny to the pupil the freedom to
exercise his own will as soon as that will has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> become sufficiently
powerful and reasonable to be an adequate agency to direct the pupil's
conduct. Many teachers and parents insist upon guiding the pupil long
after he is capable of self-direction. Here, of course, is the
critical moment in the pupil's life, and only the most careful study
of the pupil and constant prayer for Divine assistance will insure the
wisest procedure. When a boy has acquired self-control it is always a
mistake to treat him as you would a small child. His self-respect is
involved in his desire to do things in the way his own will
determines. To ignore this fact is to predispose the boy to rebellion
against his teacher; and perhaps against all constituted
authority&mdash;human and divine.</p>

<p><b>86. Teach What to do, Rather than What not to do.</b>&mdash;Above
all, do not build a negative code in the soul of a child. It is not
what he is restrained from doing, but what he is constantly
encouraged to do that makes for right will training. The great
power of Jesus as a teacher lies in his steadfast ability to teach
the world what to do, how to act, right conduct in the midst of
complex conditions. A negative code stops all endeavor, a
positive code sets the soul aglow with the consciousness of things
done, of processes initiated and completed, of struggles with
wrong successfully ended, of progress from weakness to strength,
from human error to Divine truth.</p>

<p><b>87.</b> The end of all endeavor is to do the will of God, and the
goal of all teaching is to equip a human soul to live in joyous
accord with the infinite wisdom. "Ye shall know the truth, and
the truth shall make you free."</p>

<h3>Lesson 1</h3>

<h2>The Sunday-school</h2>


<p><b>1.</b> The Sunday-school is the Bible-studying and teaching
service of the church. It is a <i>church service</i>. All the members
of the church should be connected with it. It should be under
the care and control of the church. Its purpose is to present
the Word of God, by the hand of competent living teachers, to
every man, woman and child, for the purpose of leading them to
Christ, developing their Christian characters, and training them
for service.</p>

<p><b>2. The Earliest Schools.</b><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>&mdash;Schools
for the study of God's Word seem to have existed as far back as the time of Abraham. In Moses' day,
schools were maintained for the religious training of the young. These
schools were numerous also in Ezra's time. Jesus no doubt attended
such a school in his boyhood days. The schools of his time resembled
the modern Sunday-school in some of their methods. There were
elementary schools for children, and senior schools for both children
and adults. These latter schools were connected with the synagogue. It
was through these schools, chiefly, that the Christian church was
extended and built up.</p>

<p><b>3. The Raikes Movement.</b><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>&mdash;The
first seventeen centuries of the Christian era witnessed, for the most part, a general decline in the
church and in Christian activity. During all this period, the church's
life increased or waned in proportion as it attended to or neglected
the religious instruction of the young. The seventeenth century, and
much of the eighteenth century were dark days for the church. It was
toward the close of this period that God saw fit to connect the name
of Robert Raikes with the Sunday-school movement of the world. While
he was probably not the founder of the first Sunday-school, his name
is nevertheless inseparably connected with the beginnings of the
modern Sunday-school. In the city of Gloucester, England, July, 1780,
this man&mdash;the editor and proprietor of the Gloucester Journal&mdash;started
his first Sunday-school, in the kitchen of a dwelling-house. This room
was eleven feet long, eight feet wide, six and a half feet high. "The
children were to come soon after ten in the morning and stay till
twelve. They were to go home and stay till one, and after reading a
lesson, they were to be conducted to church. After church, they were
to be employed in repeating the catechism till half past five, and
then to be dismissed with an injunction to go home without making a
noise; and by no means to play in the street." Four women were
employed as teachers in this school, at a shilling a day. The early
Raikes schools were not connected with the church in any way.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><span class="label">[A]</span>
The statements in these paragraphs are taken in substance from
"<span class="smcap">Yale Lectures on the Sunday School</span>" (Trumbull).</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>
<p><b>4. Sunday-school Extension.</b>&mdash;Sunday-schools soon became
very popular, and spread over Great Britain and into Europe.
Sunday-schools are known to have existed in the United States
as early as 1786, and probably much earlier than that (even
in 1674). They found congenial soil in the Western Hemisphere,
and multiplied rapidly. There are now more than a quarter of a
million Sunday-schools in the world, enrolling more than
twenty-five millions of people. More than one-half of this vast
army is in North America.</p>

<p><b>5. The Sunday School Union of London.</b>&mdash;This organization
was effected in 1803 in Surrey Chapel, London, and is the oldest
expression of organized Sunday-school work. It is local only
in name. Its auxiliaries are to be found in all parts of the
United Kingdom, Continental Europe and the various dependencies
of Great Britain. It holds valuable properties in London,
conducts an extensive printing establishment, and maintains
a large corps of workers as secretaries, colporteurs, etc., not only
in Great Britain but on the Continent, in India and elsewhere.</p>

<p><b>6. The American Sunday School Union.</b>&mdash;The earliest
Sunday-school organizations in North America were a Sunday
School Union in New York City in 1816, another in Boston the
same year, and still another in Philadelphia in 1817. These were
combined in 1824 into a national society known as The American
Sunday School Union. This society, through its large corps of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
missionaries, plants new Sunday-schools, especially on the
frontier. It conducts a large publishing establishment at its
headquarters in Philadelphia, and has done and is doing a
great work.</p>

<p><b>7. The National Sunday School Convention.</b>&mdash;The first national
interdenominational convention in the United States was held in the
city of New York in 1832. Delegates were present from fourteen states
and four territories. A second convention was held in the city of
Philadelphia, the following year, 1833. Not until 1859 was the third
convention held, and this one also in the city of Philadelphia. In
1869, in Newark, N. J., may be said to have begun the present series
of great conventions in our country, for they have been held
triennially from that time until the present. The fourth and last
strictly national convention was held in the city of Indianapolis in
1872. Here the International System of Uniform Lessons had its birth.
The International Lessons went into use January, 1873. They are
selected by a committee appointed by the International Convention,
co-operating with a similar committee appointed by the Sunday School
Union of London. It was decided that the next convention should be
international in character, and include the Dominion of Canada.</p>

<p><b>8. International Sunday School Movement.</b>&mdash;International
conventions have been held triennially since 1875.</p>

<p>The International Sunday School Association administers its affairs
through an Executive Committee of nearly one hundred men, representing
every state, province, territory and country in and belonging to North
America. In its main Association, and through its auxiliaries, it
employs a large number of Sunday-school workers in its various
departments. It is supported by the voluntary offerings of
Sunday-schools and individuals. Under its auspices are held annually
about sixteen thousand Sunday-school conventions, the purpose of which
is to give information, stimulation, and education along all lines of
Sunday-school work.</p>

<p><b>9. Auxiliary Associations.</b>&mdash;The various states, provinces,
territories and countries of North America maintain associations
auxiliary to the International Sunday School Association. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
oldest existing organization is that of the Province of Quebec,
which has been in continual operation since 1836. The states
and provinces, for the most part, maintain annual conventions.
Auxiliary to these auxiliaries are the associations of the counties
or next smaller political divisions. In the thickly settled portions
of the country, still smaller organizations are effected in
the townships and cities.</p>

<p><b>10. The World's Sunday School Association.</b>&mdash;The First World's Sunday
School Convention was held in the city of London, England, in 1889,
about two hundred and fifty delegates attending from North America.
The Second World's Convention was held in connection with the Seventh
International Convention at St. Louis, Missouri, in 1893. The Third
World's Convention was held again in London in 1898. Three hundred
delegates were present from North America. The Fourth World's
Convention was held in Jerusalem, Palestine, in 1904. Over eight
hundred delegates attended from North America, and nearly five hundred
from Great Britain, traveling in chartered steamships. The World's
Fifth Sunday School Convention was held in the city of Rome, Italy, in
1907, with over eleven hundred delegates. And there the World's Sunday
School Association was organized, to hold conventions, gather
statistics, and to co-operate with other organizations in increasing
the efficiency of Sunday-schools throughout the world. The World's
Sixth Sunday School Convention is to be held in Washington, D. C.,
1910.</p>

<h3>Lesson 2</h3>

<h2>The Sunday-school Equipped</h2>


<p><b>11. Buildings.</b>&mdash;A discussion of Sunday-school buildings
properly comes under the head of equipment, but as that is a
large topic by itself, it is not our purpose to consider it here but
to confine ourselves to those features of equipment which may
be used in any building. The buildings should be made with the
needs and conveniences of the Sunday-school in mind. The
department rooms and class rooms are but expressions of this
idea. The school deserves as good a room as the preaching
service, and one as thoroughly adapted to its uses. Department
rooms and class rooms can often be temporarily arranged
by the use of curtains or screens, in a building where no regular
partitions have been provided.</p>

<p><b>12. Seating.</b>&mdash;Chairs are better than pews. They should be
comfortable, and adapted to the size of the pupils who are to
use them. No one can sit quietly very long unless his feet can
rest squarely on the floor. If the room is not carpeted, the
chair legs should have rubber tips.</p>

<p><b>13. Tables.</b>&mdash;Such of the officers as need to use desks or
tables should have tables of their own, so that all of their books,
blanks, and supplies may be kept in proper order. Class tables
are very desirable. They need not be very large. Each table
should have a drawer or box in it for the song-books and other
property of the class. This economizes time and saves confusion,
as nothing will need to be distributed.</p>

<p><b>14. Class Boxes.</b>&mdash;Where it is impossible to use class tables,
a class box is next in value. It should contain the song-books
and everything else belonging to the class, and should be kept
in a given place where some member of the class can secure it
before the school, and replace it after the school is closed.</p>

<p><b>15. Blackboards.</b>&mdash;It is impossible to overestimate the
value of blackboards in Sunday-school work when rightly used.
There ought to be one in the main school, and one in every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
department room. It would be well, also, if there were a small
blackboard in every class room. It can be used for so many
purposes, such as reviewing the lesson, announcing hymns or
displaying reports. The revolving blackboard is the best for
general use, and the most ornamental. Square crayons of half
an inch, or one inch, in size are better than the ordinary round
school crayon. Simple work is better than elaborate work.
Anybody can use a blackboard to advantage, whether he can
draw or not.</p>

<p><b>16. Maps.</b>&mdash;If a school can have but one map, let it be the map of
Palestine. Then add the following maps, in the order named: Bible
Lands; a second map of Palestine,&mdash;one for Old Testament and one for
New Testament; Paul's missionary journeys; a missionary map of the
world; a missionary map of the denomination. A sand map is good for
use in the later elementary grades, but should not wholly displace the
wall map.</p>

<p><b>17. Charts.</b>&mdash;Many helpful charts are now prepared for Sunday-school
use; charts of the life of Christ, charts for missionary purposes and
temperance teaching, charts with choice passages of Scripture and
hymns.</p>

<p><b>18. Libraries.</b>&mdash;If possible, have two libraries, one for teachers, one
for scholars. A teachers' library should contain Bible-study helps and
books for Sunday-school workers, which treat of special phases of
Sunday-school work. The scholars' library should be properly
classified so that the members of all departments will feel an equal
interest in it.</p>

<p><b>19. Missionary Curios.</b>&mdash;Material aid in creating missionary
interest will be secured by showing woods, stones, plants, flowers,
clothing, and birds from the various foreign fields, and by the
use of pictures and models of their buildings, which reveal the
customs of the lands under consideration. These things are
abundant, and are comparatively inexpensive.</p>

<p><b>20. Flags and Banners.</b>&mdash;Every school should have the
flag of the nation displayed at each session. Many schools use
the Christian flag, also, made of white silk with a blue field and
red cross. The "Conquest Flag" is also popular. Banners for
Star Classes, Excelsior Classes, Honor Classes, etc., are desirable
if properly used. Considerable school spirit may be cultivated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
by having school colors embodied in a pennant, which is always
displayed when the school is in session.</p>

<p><b>21. Objects.</b>&mdash;Many objects are now prepared that are valuable in
Sunday-school work, such as building blocks, models of the Tabernacle,
globes, and birthday banks.</p>

<p><b>22. Bibles and Music Books.</b>&mdash;Every member of the school who is old
enough to read should bring his own Bible. Nevertheless, it is well to
have a supply of school Bibles, as they should be used in the school
instead of lesson helps. Select a good music book, and get plenty of
copies. If every member has a book, the singing and the order will be
better. Hymn banners and song rolls are useful adjuncts.</p>

<p><b>23. Pictures.</b>&mdash;Choice pictures are not only beautiful, but
valuable in many ways. The walls of the Sunday-school room,
and especially of the elementary departments, should be well
decorated with choice inexpensive pictures, illustrating various
Bible scenes; there may also be miscellaneous pictures of an
equally elevating and refining character.</p>

<p><b>24. Stereopticon.</b>&mdash;Here and there a school is able to have
a stereopticon or magic lantern. This instrument is becoming
more popular every day. If properly used, a stereopticon is
very helpful in Sunday-school work.</p>

<p><b>25. Lesson Helps.</b>&mdash;Supply yourselves with plenty of lesson
helps for officers, teachers, and scholars. Get the very best, but
<i>leave them at home on Sunday</i>.</p>

<p><b>26. Records and Printing.</b>&mdash;Records that are worth keeping,
at all, are worth keeping well, and in well-made books. All
printing should be well done or not done at all. Business houses
are judged by their printing; Sunday-schools likewise. Use
good paper, occasionally colored inks, and let all the printing
be neat and tasteful.</p>

<p><b>27. Bells.</b>&mdash;Bells are useful, if not used too much. Do not
use a gong. A small tea bell is large enough for an ordinary
room. The less noise the superintendent makes, the less noise
the scholars will make.</p>

<p><b>28. Equipment for Hand-Work.</b>&mdash;This comparatively new
feature of Sunday-school work is rapidly gaining favor. It is
usually the most successful in the Junior Department, though it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
is used extensively in both the Primary and Intermediate
departments. In this brief paragraph, we can but mention
some of the phases of hand-work, as follows:&mdash;The sand map;
the pulp map; map drawing; written lesson outlines; cutting
and pasting pictures in blank books (with or without writing),
treating of the current lessons, or missionary lands and themes;
sewing; modeling Oriental objects in clay, pulp, etc., etc.</p>

<h3>Lesson 3</h3>

<h2>The Sunday-school Organized</h2>


<p><b>29.</b> A Sunday-school is organized for work when (1) the
official positions are filled; (2) there are teachers for all the
classes; (3) the scholars are properly enrolled and classified;
(4) and it has intelligently set itself thoroughly to accomplish,
in a definite way, that for which a Sunday-school stands.</p>

<p><b>30. Enrolment.</b>&mdash;The name of every member of the school
should be enrolled either in a book or by the card system. The
enrolment should show not only name and address, but date of
entry, birthday, date of promotion from one department to
another, date of uniting with the church, date and cause of
leaving the school; date of death, if necessary.</p>

<p><b>31. Classification (or Grading).</b>&mdash;Classification consists in
placing the scholars in such departments and classes as will
secure for them and for the whole school the best results in the
best manner. This will require that the scholars be advanced
from one department to another at proper intervals, in order
to meet their changing needs.</p>

<p><b>32. Departments.</b>&mdash;Every Sunday-school should be divided
into departments. Three or four departments are possible in
the smallest schools, and more are desirable in larger ones. It is
usually possible to maintain the following departments in an
ordinary school:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) <i>The Cradle Roll</i>, for children too small to attend the regular
sessions. These are usually under three years of age.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Beginners</i>, for children from three to six.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The Primary</i>, for children from six to nine.</p>

<p>(4) <i>The Junior</i>, for children from nine to eleven or twelve.</p>

<p>(5) <i>The Intermediate</i>, for boys and girls from twelve to fifteen or
sixteen. (In some schools, a Senior Department, coming between the
Intermediate and the Adult, is recognized.)</p>

<p>(6) <i>Adult</i>, for all over fifteen or sixteen.</p>

<p>(7) <i>The Home Department</i>, for those who cannot attend, but who will
study the lessons each week.</p>

<p>(8) <i>The Teacher-Training Department</i>, for those who are preparing to
become teachers.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>In many schools of several hundred or more, the Adult Department
indicated above is divided into a Young Men's Department, a Young
Women's Department, and a Senior Department of classes of either sex.</p>

<p>An educational test may be required for promotion with honors from one
department to the other; but transfer (without honors) may be made
upon the age basis. Without departments there can be no thorough
grading.</p>

<p><b>33. Departmental Organization.</b>&mdash;Each department should have some
organization within itself, at least a superintendent in general
charge. The superintendent of the department determines in what
classes new scholars shall be enrolled, and carries into effect the
plans of work outlined by the cabinet or the superintendent of the
Sunday-school. The teachers should be especially adapted to the work
of the department, and should remain in that department as long as
they can do their best work there.</p>

<p><b>34. Classification (or Grading.)</b>&mdash;Proper classification cannot be
maintained unless some one especially appointed for this purpose gives
it careful attention every Sunday. Neither teachers nor scholars
should be allowed to bring new members into their classes without the
consent of the officer in charge of the classification, nor should new
scholars be permitted to join whatever class they wish, regardless of
proper classification. Eternal vigilance is the price of grading. The
superintendent of classification will determine to what department the
new scholar belongs, and his word should be final.</p>

<p><b>35. Promotions.</b>&mdash;There comes a time when a scholar ceases to belong in
one department, and belongs in another. Promotions should be made
regularly, and at a public service. All members of the school up to
and including the intermediate scholars should be promoted at the same
time, changing seats, as far as possible.</p>

<p><b>36. Records.</b>&mdash;The general records of the school should be
well kept, in ink, in a good book adapted to the purpose. There
should be annual, quarterly, and weekly reports which should be
comparative and complete.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<h4>Officers and their Duties</h4>

<p><b>37.</b> The officers will vary in number and work, according
to the size of the school and the character of its organization.
Certain officers, however, are needed, no matter how large or
small the school may be. Many schools are under-officered;
it is oftener so than otherwise. Not all of the officers we shall
name here could be profitably used in a small school, and yet
each of them is important.</p>

<p><b>38. The Pastor.</b>&mdash;Since the Sunday-school is a church service,
the pastor not only has privileges there, but has responsibilities
as well. His chief responsibility lies in the directing of the
teaching, for the pastor of a church is as responsible for the
teaching that is done in his Sunday-school as for the teaching
that is done from his pulpit. This determines largely his place
of greatest opportunity&mdash;the selecting of material for the teacher-training
class, and helping to select and appoint the teachers in
all departments of the school. He should not act as superintendent,
if it can be avoided, neither should he usually teach a
class, except as a substitute teacher. He should attend the
school regularly, and have a vital part in the program of every
session.</p>

<p><b>39. The Superintendent.</b>&mdash;The superintendent should be
regarded as a church officer, and, except in union and mission
Sunday-schools, should be elected by the church to which the
Sunday-school belongs, in the same manner as other church
officers are elected. He should have general charge of the
Sunday-school, and be regarded as its executive head. He
should have sole authority to appoint all of the other officers
of the school: such appointment to be confirmed either by the
church or some body representing it, such as a Sunday-school
Board or teachers' meeting.  He should have a voice in the
appointing of the teachers in all departments. During the school
session he should study the school, seeking to discover the
weak places and how to strengthen them.</p>

<p><b>40. The Assistant Superintendent.</b>&mdash;The assistant superintendent
should take charge of the school in the superintendent's
absence, and should also have specific duties to perform in every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
regular session. These duties will be determined by the size
and requirements of the school, and the efficiency of the other
officers.</p>

<p><b>41. The Secretary.</b>&mdash;The name of this officer indicates his duties. His
reports should be neatly kept in ink, in a book prepared for the
purpose. They should be comprehensive and comparative, so that it may
be determined at a glance whether the school is growing or not. He
should make reports weekly, quarterly, and annually.</p>

<p><b>42. The Treasurer.</b>&mdash;The duties of this officer are likewise
indicated by his name. He should be more, however, than the
custodian of funds. He should endeavor to increase the offerings
to the proper amount. He will pay out money only upon orders
properly placed in his hands.</p>


<h4>Test Questions</h4>

<p>1. Name four conditions that mark the organized Sunday-school.</p>

<p>2. What facts should enrolment show?</p>

<p>3. What is meant by grading?</p>

<p>4. Name the principal departments into which a school may
be divided.</p>

<p>5. What officer should receive and locate new scholars?</p>

<p>6. What are some of the factors in wise promotion of school
members?</p>

<p>7. State the pastor's chief responsibility for the school.</p>

<h3>Lesson 4</h3>

<h2>The Sunday-school Organized (Concluded)</h2>


<p><b>43. The Superintendent of Classification.</b>&mdash;This office may
be filled by one of the assistant superintendents, but in a school
of one hundred or more, it is well to have a separate officer. His
duty will be to classify the new scholars, first ascertaining by
personal investigation the department in which the new scholar
belongs. This is a most important office, and cannot be neglected
a single Sunday without detriment to the grading of the school.</p>

<p><b>44. The Librarian.</b>&mdash;This officer should have charge of the
library or libraries and of all supplies. New books should have
his approval before being added to the library. He should properly
classify the books, so that those in each department may
know which are best adapted to their needs. It would be well,
if possible, to give him control of a library fund, with authority
to add one or two books at a time as the funds will allow. All
such books should be announced from the platform on the day
they are placed in the library. A library maintained in this
way will always be fresh, and never lose its interest.</p>

<p><b>45. The Birthday Secretary.</b>&mdash;This officer takes charge of the birthday
contributions of the members. Each member of the school may be asked
to contribute on his birthday as many pennies as he is years old, or
as much more as he may choose. The money thus gathered may be used for
benevolent and missionary purposes and become the means of creating
considerable interest.</p>

<p><b>46. The Substitute Teacher Secretary.</b>&mdash;This officer should
see that classes whose teachers are temporarily absent are supplied
with teachers. Having secured a list of names of those who will
substitute, he should send notices each Monday to those who are
pledged for the following Sunday, notifying them that their
date is at hand, and asking them also to attend the Workers'
Meeting that week.</p>

<p><b>47. The Biographer.</b>&mdash;Some schools call this officer the Historian. He
keeps in a book, or by the card system, permanent records of all the
members, with date of entering the school and other items of interest,
such as date of promotion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> of joining church, removals, deaths, etc.
Where this work is properly done, the records become exceedingly
interesting and valuable.</p>

<p><b>48. The Door Men.</b>&mdash;A door man should be placed in charge
of each door entering the building, or opening from one room
into another. These door men should know just when the doors
may be opened for people to pass without interfering with the
school. They should be in their place before the school begins,
allowing none to enter the room when their entrance would
disturb the services. They should pay special attention to
strangers and visitors, and prevent boisterous conduct or talking
about the doors.</p>

<p><b>49. The Ushers.</b>&mdash;Every school should have at least one
usher, and as many more as are needed. In a school of three
hundred or over, several ushers can be used profitably. They
should be in their places early, to pay proper attention to visitors,
and to see that they do not occupy seats intended for regular
scholars. They can also look after new scholars as they enter,
and see that they are directed to the Superintendent of
Classification.</p>

<p><b>50. The Courtesy Committee.</b>&mdash;This committee will be needed chiefly in
larger schools. Its purpose is to make visitors welcome, and show them
every courtesy that is possible. The Courtesy Committee relieves the
superintendent and other officers of this particular duty, thus
enabling such officers to do those things for which they are
responsible. Visitors greatly appreciate this attention, and will go
away with a good impression of the school. A Guest Book may be kept,
to secure the names of visitors.</p>

<p><b>51. The Missionary Secretary.</b>&mdash;Every Sunday-school ought
to be a missionary society. The Missionary Secretary will endeavor
to cultivate missionary interest and spirit in the school.
He can do this by securing a proper distribution of missionary
literature, by helping to prepare missionary programs and
concerts, by keeping in touch with those phases of mission work
supported by the school, or church or denomination, and reporting
from time to time. He will have charge of the missionary
maps, charts, and curios.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p><b>52. The Temperance Secretary.</b>&mdash;This officer should endeavor
to cultivate the spirit of temperance and good citizenship.
If temperance pledges are used in the school, it would be
well for him to keep a record of them, and to enter the names
permanently in a book, reporting from time to time how many
names he has. He can aid the superintendent, also, by helping
to prepare temperance concerts, and by introducing various
appropriate features into the program on Temperance Sunday.</p>

<p><b>53. The Superintendent's Aides.</b>&mdash;These are usually boys,
twelve to sixteen years of age, who are hands and feet for the
superintendent. They prepare the platform and room for the
school service, put the blackboard into place, adjust the hymn-board
and the flags, if they are used. They may also distribute
the hymn-books and Bibles.</p>

<p><b>54. The Messenger Cadets.</b>&mdash;These are usually boys of the
Junior Department, and their chief business is to carry messages
to absentees, flowers to the sick, or messages to any one, for the
superintendent or pastor. Under the direction of the Home
Department Superintendent they may deliver the quarterlies
and other supplies. They should be in charge of a man who
understands boys and loves to work with them.</p>

<p><b>55. The Sunshine Band.</b>&mdash;This is usually made up of girls of
the Junior age, who visit the sick, carry them flowers, sing and
read to them, and minister to them in every way they can.
They should be in charge of a woman appointed for this work.</p>

<p><b>56. The Department Superintendents.</b>&mdash;These should be looked upon as
officers of the Sunday-school. Each superintendent is expected to
preside in his own department, with as much care as if it were the
entire school; to preserve the grading provided for by the
superintendent of classification; to endeavor to keep the classes as
nearly uniform in size as possible; and to cultivate a department life
and interest.</p>

<p><b>57. The Superintendent's Cabinet.</b>&mdash;All of the officers
named above, and the Chairmen of all the committees named
above, constitute the Superintendent's Cabinet. Nothing should
be presented to the teachers or to the school as a whole until it
has first been decided upon by the Cabinet. The Cabinet should
have regular meetings, perhaps once a month.</p>

<h3>Lesson 5</h3>

<h2>The Sunday-school in Session</h2>


<p><b>58.</b> The Sunday-school session is not the Sunday-school, for
the same reason that a church service is not the church. The
session begins, carries out a certain program, and closes. The
Sunday-school continues throughout the week. Much previous
planning and preparation are essential to the success of any
Sunday-school session.</p>

<p><b>59. Time.</b>&mdash;The most convenient hour is the best hour. Having
discovered that hour, hold to it the year round. Frequent changes will
bring disaster. Every hour has its advantages and disadvantages. The
morning hour is usually attended by more tardiness of teachers and
scholars, but all are fresher. The noon hour will suffer less from
tardiness and will have a larger attendance of adults. Discipline will
be more of a problem, especially if the school is continued far beyond
the dinner time. The afternoon hour has the following advantages: (1)
The school does not precede nor follow another service, which is
detrimental to both. (2) A completely rounded program can be carried
out because the time will be longer. (3) There is opportunity for
after-meetings, if desired. Many of the best schools are held in the
afternoon. There are the following disadvantages, however: (1) It
breaks in upon the Sunday afternoon home life. (2) It prevents the
members from working in mission schools, etc. (3) It may interfere
with the attendance at the night services.</p>

<p><b>60. Length of Session.</b>&mdash;The usual session is one hour long,
but this is too short to secure the best results. An hour and a
quarter is better, and is long enough for a morning or noon school.
Under good management, an afternoon school can use an hour
and a half to advantage.</p>

<p><b>61. Program.</b>&mdash;The superintendent should have a written
program, and know his ground every step of the way. The
pastor and chorister should have copies. So also should every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
individual participant. The passing from one feature of the
program to the next should be done quickly, and, so far as possible,
without announcement.</p>

<p><b>62. How to Begin.</b>&mdash;Be ready. Insist that all officers and
teachers shall be ready. Begin exactly on time. Do not wait
for anything nor anybody. Be sure all understand the signal
for beginning. Give the signal once, <i>never oftener</i>. Wait for
silence. Do not begin without it.</p>

<p><b>63. Signals.</b>&mdash;Use the bell sparingly, if at all. For certain signals
the bell may be desirable, but never to secure order. A chord on the
piano is better than a bell. Piano signals should be arranged so that
a signal given in a certain way always means the same thing. The
superintendent's rising in his place, or, if standing, simply raising
his hand, should be signal enough to secure the attention of any
school. It will be, if the school is properly trained, and so seated
as to be able to see a signal.</p>

<p><b>64. Music.</b>&mdash;An orchestra is good, but should not be too
large for the room. A piano is better than an ordinary organ
because of its distinct tones. The next best instrument to add
is a violin for a small room and a cornet for a large one. Do not
consume too much time with instrumental music in the session.
The orchestra can give an overture at the opening, a number
while classes reassemble after the teaching period, and a postlude
at the close. That is sufficient. The superintendent should
select the hymns, in conference with the chorister. Some of
them should be appropriate to the lesson of the day. Use one
or two old church hymns at each session. Select a good book,
and have plenty of copies. The best results cannot be secured
where even two sing from the same book. The hymn numbers
should be placed on the blackboard or hymn-board, before the
opening, in plain sight of all.</p>

<p><b>65. Prayers.</b>&mdash;Sunday-school prayers should never be long,
and those who pray aloud should keep the children in mind.
All the rest will follow. Two or three short prayers at different
times are better than one long prayer.</p>

<p><b>66. Memorizing Scripture.</b>&mdash;Every school should repeat some Scripture
from memory every Sunday. Select the verses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> carefully, and not too
many of them. A few verses thoroughly memorized are better than many
imperfectly learned.</p>

<p><b>67. Lesson Study.</b>&mdash;The lesson study period should be the
heart of the session. It should never have less than thirty
minutes. Hold this period sacred to the teachers, without interruption
of any kind. No visiting of classes by officers at this
time should be permitted. The necessary business of the session
should be conducted during the opening and closing services.
Do not distribute books nor papers to the classes until the close
of school&mdash;certainly not during the teaching period.</p>

<p><b>68. Review.</b>&mdash;The superintendent should not review the
entire lesson; he should mention only that part of it which
enables him to fix the personal application he has in mind for
the school that day. The blackboard will help if properly used.</p>

<p><b>69. Reports.</b>&mdash;Reports should be few, and very short, never
in detail. Calling the roll of officers and teachers is a waste of
time. To give the number present, the number absent, the
offering for the day, the missionary collection, and the names
of the sick is usually sufficient, except in cases of emergency,
such as deaths or funerals.</p>

<p><b>70. Announcements.</b>&mdash;The fewer announcements the better. Those that
must be made should be brief, plain, striking. Do not call them
"announcements." Work them in, one at a time, as comments on the
program in hand. The announcement that you have an announcement to
make is an announcement wasted, and time wasted, too. Never take the
time of all to make an announcement that concerns but a few. Do not
fall into set forms. Announcements may be interesting and instructive,
but usually they are not so. They should be made a study.</p>

<p><b>71. How to Close.</b>&mdash;The lesson review or application should
be followed by a short prayer. Then sing a sweet, familiar
hymn bearing upon the truth you have tried to impress, the
school remaining seated. Then the benediction, school still
seated. Then a moment of silent prayer, followed by the
piano or orchestra softly playing the music that has just been
sung. Let this be the signal for dismissal.</p>

<h3>Lesson 6</h3>

<h2>The Sunday-school Teacher</h2>


<p><b>72. The Teacher's Office.</b>&mdash;Next to the minister of the
gospel, the Sunday-school teacher occupies the highest office
in Christian service. The central and most important feature
of every Sunday-school session is the Bible-teaching period.
All the other exercises of the school should be so arranged as to
make the teaching period as effective as possible. The teachers
do the teaching; hence the importance of the office. The
character of the teacher and the efficiency of the teaching usually
determine the efficiency of the school; like teacher, like school.</p>

<p><b>73. The Teacher in Prospect.</b>&mdash;Probably the greatest
problem in Sunday-school work, at present, is that of securing a
sufficient number of good teachers. The only solution of this
problem is for every school to have at least one teacher-training
class each year. Any school which sets itself definitely to the
task of training its own teachers, from its own ranks, for its own
classes, will reduce the teacher problem to a minimum. Such a
class should be composed of young men and women between the
ages of sixteen and thirty, specially chosen by the pastor and
superintendent because of their interest in the work and apparent
fitness for it. The class should be taught by the best teacher
obtainable, though he need not be an expert. It should meet at
the church, at the regular Sunday-school hour, thus solving the
difficulty as to time and place. Substitute teachers should
never be drawn from this class. A teacher's diploma should be
issued to each student completing the course and passing the
required examination.</p>

<p><b>74. The Teacher Trained.</b>&mdash;Many who are now teaching
desire to take a teacher-training course. Difficult though it is
to maintain a class for such workers, it can be done. Evidently
it cannot meet at the Sunday-school hour, as the teachers are
already occupied. A full week-night is preferable, if it can be
had; if not, it may come before or after the Workers' Meeting or
prayer-meeting, though this arrangement is always more or less
detrimental to both meetings. Interdenominational training-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>classes
are much better than none, but the training-class in the
local church is the ideal, and should be maintained wherever it
is possible. When it is impossible to attend a teacher-training
class, or there is none, individuals may take a course alone, and
this is often done.</p>

<p><b>75. The Teacher Chosen.</b>&mdash;The teacher should be chosen
and appointed by the proper authority representing the church
and the Sunday-school. The committee for appointing teachers
should be composed of three persons: the pastor of the church,
the superintendent of the Sunday-school, and the superintendent
of the department where the teacher is to teach. If there is a
separate superintendent of teachers in the Sunday-school, he
may represent the superintendent of the school in this capacity.
No one should be set over any class as teacher whose appointment
is not satisfactory to the three persons named above.</p>

<p><b>76. The Teacher Installed.</b>&mdash;The Sunday-school is a church
service, hence the teacher should be properly recognized by the
church. It is desirable that all the officers and teachers should
be assembled and installed in their offices for the coming year
with fitting exercises, at a regular service of the church. Such
a service as this dignifies the office of the Sunday-school teacher,
places upon him the approbation of the church, and makes him
feel that his work is appreciated. The installation service should
be in charge of the pastor of the church, and the officers and
teachers should be seated in a body. Appropriate exercises for
such a service have been arranged, and may be easily secured
from the denominational publishing houses.</p>

<p><b>77. The Teacher Protected.</b>&mdash;During the general opening and closing
exercises of the Sunday-school session the superintendent is in
charge. But during the teaching period the teacher outranks everybody
else, and is entitled to the full time set apart for teaching without
any interruption. The officers of the school should not be allowed to
disturb the classes in any way. The making of the class reports,
gathering of the offering, and similar matters, should be attended to
before the recitation begins, and in such a manner as to make the
least interference with the class work. It is a sin to disturb a class
unnecessarily after the teaching has begun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p><b>78. The Teacher Between Sundays.</b>&mdash;The wise teacher will
regard the intervening week between two sessions of the school
as the time of his greatest opportunity. He will review in his
mind the experiences of the previous Sunday, endeavoring to
learn therefrom how to improve his work in the future. He will
give himself diligently to the preparation of his lesson and to the
visiting of the absent, and will be especially careful to call upon
the sick members of his class. He will attend the Workers'
Meeting, and avail himself of every opportunity for improvement.
He will seek personal interviews with those of his scholars who
have been troublesome in the matter of discipline, and will talk
individually with all the members of his class in order to win
them to Christ. He will identify himself with the International
Reading Circle, as a member of which he pledges to read at least
one good Sunday-school book each year, and thus keep in touch
with the Sunday-school movements of the world.</p>

<p><b>79. The Teacher's Aim.</b>&mdash;The teacher should aim, first of
all, to win the confidence and esteem of his scholars. Until
this is done little else is possible, because there can be no effective
teaching without co-operation. He should give his scholars
faithful and efficient instruction in the Word of God. The
lesson itself should be taught each Sunday, and not allowed to be
brushed aside by the discussion of any other topic, though other
topics may be used to introduce or illustrate the lesson. He
should endeavor to lead his scholars to an acceptance of the Lord
Jesus Christ as their Saviour. This is oftener accomplished
by a personal interview than in the class. He should aim to
lead his scholars into membership in the local church. He
should aim, by careful training and instruction, to build his
scholars up into strong Christian characters, and to fit them for
the duties of civic and religious life. Let him remember that his
work is for eternity.</p>

<p><b>80. The Teacher's Reward.</b>&mdash;The teacher receives much of
his reward as he goes along, but not all of it. The privilege of
being associated with the Great Teacher, and laboring in obedience
to his command; the joy of leading souls to Jesus Christ,
and sending them out into the world as witnesses for him; the
consciousness of growing power in service because of work well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
done; the companionship of kindred spirits engaged in the same
great work&mdash;these are surely rewards enough. But there is
another reward when the work is done. It is God's "Well done"
to the faithful.</p>

<h3>Lesson 7</h3>

<h2>The Workers' Meeting</h2>


<p><b>81.</b> The meeting which is commonly called the Teachers'-Meeting we
prefer to call the Workers' Meeting, because it should be as helpful
to the officers as to the teachers. It is impossible to overestimate
the value of a properly conducted Workers' Meeting, and yet it is
difficult to maintain one. A Sunday-school without a Workers' Meeting
is a collection of classes, and not a school at all, strictly
speaking. A helpful Workers' Meeting maintained regularly every week
guarantees a good Sunday-school. It is a thermometer accurately
indicating the true condition of the school. To the tired worker it is
a refreshing port-of-call between the two continents of Sunday; to the
discouraged, it is a heart stimulant; to the over-busy, it is a
storehouse filled with what they need, and ready for their use. To all
who are willing to pay the price of the best work, it is a necessity.</p>

<p><b>82. Leadership.</b>&mdash;The superintendent should preside. It is
his meeting. The program should be in his hands, and of his
making. He should not teach the lesson unless he is the best
qualified person to do it. He should have a special message for
the workers at each meeting, bearing upon some phase of the
work.</p>

<p><b>83. Equipment.</b>&mdash;All who attend should have their own
Bibles. Tablets and pencils should either be brought from
home or be furnished by the school. There should be a good
blackboard at hand, also the necessary maps and charts for
lesson study. A teachers' library is very important, and the
librarian should be present, so that the workers may take home
the books if they desire. Models of the tabernacle with its
furniture, the temple, an Oriental house, etc., will be helpful.
Leaflets on various phases of the work, for distribution, may
profitably be used from time to time.</p>

<p><b>84. Who Should Attend.</b>&mdash;Certainly the pastor. The
teachers are his best helpers; the Sunday-school is the whitest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
part of his great field. He cannot afford not to be in vital touch
with the workers of the Sunday-school. He may or may not be
the best person to teach the lesson. All the officers of the
school should be there, for the details of their official duties will
be discussed from time to time. Of course the teachers will be
there, and the substitute teachers who are to act on the following
Sunday. It would be well also for the prospective teachers or
the members of the training class to be present, if possible.
Some schools require the attendance of the teachers upon this
meeting.</p>

<p><b>85.</b> <b>The purpose of the meeting</b> is to study the school, to
plan for the school work, to create Sunday-school enthusiasm;
to disseminate Sunday-school intelligence; to maintain a vital
relation to the great Sunday-school movements of the day; to
show how to teach the lesson for the following Sunday. It is
to help, instruct, encourage, and equip the officers and teachers
at every point, and in every way.</p>

<p><b>86. Time and Place.</b>&mdash;If possible, devote an evening to it,
late in the week and at the church. Settle upon one night and
stick to it. Those who are absent will always know exactly when
and where the next meeting will be held. No more important
meeting is ever held at the church than this, and it ought to have
the right of way one night in the week. It is a short-sighted
policy on the part of any church to deny this.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>
<p><b>87. Methods of Lesson Work.</b>&mdash;The Workers' Meeting is not a Bible
class. To conduct it as one will usually kill it. A good Workers'
Meeting presupposes previous preparation of the lesson on the part of
the teachers. They do not come there to study the lesson. Other things
being equal, that Workers' Meeting is the best which, under wise
leadership, has the largest number of participants. It should be
conducted on the catechetical rather than the lecture plan. The method
of presenting the lesson should have more consideration than the
subject-matter. The "Angle Method" of conducting the lesson periods of
a Workers' Meeting is very popular, and is explained by the following,
which may be printed on cards, and handed a week in advance to ten
persons, each of whom is asked to be prepared on a given "Angle."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Angle No. 1&mdash;Approach.</b></p>

<p>Give subject of last lesson, brief intervening history, time,
place, and circumstances leading to this lesson.</p>

<p>Let the lesson text be read at this point.</p>


<p><b>Angle No. 2&mdash;The Lesson Story.</b></p>

<p>Give the lesson story in your own words.</p>


<p><b>Angle No. 3&mdash;Analysis.</b></p>

<p>Give one or more simple working outlines for studying and
teaching this lesson. Use the blackboard if convenient.</p>


<p><b>Angle No. 4&mdash;Biography.</b></p>

<p>Give the names of persons, classes, and nations mentioned
or referred to in the lesson.</p>


<p><b>Angle No. 5&mdash;Orientalisms.</b></p>

<p>Give any Oriental customs or manners peculiar to this lesson.</p>


<p><b>Angle No. 6&mdash;Central Truth.</b></p>

<p>Give the central truth of the lesson and your reason for its
choice.</p>


<p><b>Angle No. 7&mdash;First Step.</b></p>

<p>Give a good way to introduce this lesson so as to secure
attention from the start.</p>


<p><b>Angle No. 8&mdash;Primary.</b></p>

<p>Give the features of this lesson which are best adapted to
small children.</p>


<p><b>Angle No. 9&mdash;Illustrations.</b></p>

<p>Give a few incidents or facts that will serve as illustrations.</p>


<p><b>Angle No. 10&mdash;Practical Lessons.</b></p>

<p>Give the most practical lessons in personally applying the
truths of this lesson.</p></div>

<p>The leader should be prepared on all the "Angles," so that he can
take the place of any one who is absent.</p>

<p><b>88. Program.</b>&mdash;Begin with a bright, earnest, tender devotional service
of ten minutes, remembering in prayer any who may be sick, and special
cases of interest mentioned by those present. Then devote fifteen or
twenty minutes, according to the need, to some feature of the school
work previously decided upon. It may be a discussion of finances, led
by the treasurer, or of the records, led by the secretary, or of
grading, led by the superintendent of classification, or a
consideration of a given department, led by the superintendent of that
department. Follow this with thirty or thirty-five minutes in the
consideration of the lesson. Then devote about ten minutes to messages
or suggestions from the pastor or superintendent, or both, closing
with a five-minute service of prayer and song. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> service can be
made to come within an hour, by shortening some of the items named
above. At the close of the Workers' Meeting, spend a few minutes in
social intercourse. A Workers' Meeting conducted after this manner
will be a veritable dynamo of power for the Sunday-school, and none
who can attend will willingly remain away.</p>

<h3>Lesson 8</h3>

<h2>Sunday-school Finance</h2>


<p><b>89. Christian giving is Christian worship.</b> No test of Christian
character is so accurate or severe as the motive and method
of giving. Giving is a Christian grace, and the Sunday-school
is the best place to cultivate it. The Sunday-school should be
the "West Point" of the church, in this as in other things.
Since the Sunday-school is a church service, the church is evidently
responsible for its maintenance and support. It does not
follow, however, that the church should pour into the Sunday-school
all the money it needs, nor that the Sunday-school should
give away all the money it raises.</p>

<p><b>90. The Financial Board.</b>&mdash;There is in many a church, and
should be in every one, a board having the special care of the
finances of the Sunday-school. This board should be composed
of certain officials in both the church and the Sunday-school, so
that their action may be wise and intelligent. Certainly the
pastor, superintendent, church treasurer, and school treasurer
should be members of this board. They should be empowered
to carry out the financial policy of the school, direct in all matters
of financial detail, audit all bills, and see that these are promptly
paid, so the good credit of the school may be maintained.</p>

<p><b>91. The Budget.</b>&mdash;At the beginning of each year a carefully
prepared budget should be presented by the Financial Board,
indicating how much money the school will be asked to raise,
and what proportion of it should be used for benevolences,
church support, school expenses, etc. A liberal allowance
should be made for unexpected expenditures that cannot be
foreseen. The budget should be printed, so that each member
may have a copy. If satisfactory, the budget may be accepted
by the school, by vote, as an indication of its loyalty to the
board and to the church.</p>

<p><b>92. Right Motives in Giving.</b>&mdash;All giving should be "as unto the Lord."
The scholars should be taught that we are all stewards, and that
everything we have belongs to God. Sunday-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>schools properly imbued
with right motives in giving to-day mean churches aflame with
financial and spiritual power to-morrow. When the motive is right,
giving is a means of Christian growth. Love is the only worthy motive;
giving is the test of love. You can give without loving, but you
cannot love without giving; God <i>so loved</i> the World that he <i>gave</i>
his only son. Without love, there is no joy in giving. Without joy in
giving, we cannot please him; "God loveth a cheerful giver." No deeper
joy ever comes to the Christian heart than the joy of right giving.
Jesus said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive." Every
Sunday-school should be taught this truth, and taught why it is truth.</p>

<p><b>93. Right Methods in Giving.</b>&mdash;Every member of the
school should be asked to contribute a certain amount regularly
each Sunday, making up the same in cases of absence. This
amount should be decided upon by the scholar in conference
with his parents or the teacher, unless the scholar earns his own
money. Avoid spasmodic efforts in raising money. In the end,
the effect on the school is not good, and the results are not
satisfactory. Every member should be urged to give something,
no matter how small. The sum given should be in proportion
to the ability to give, and not gauged by what others do. One
of the safest foundations that can be laid for the development
of Christian character and a happy life is to fix in youth the
habit of regular, systematic, intelligent giving. Small, dated
envelopes for each scholar, one for each Sunday, stating the
purpose for which the money is used, generally insure larger
offerings and greater satisfaction to the givers. Do not gather
the offering during the singing or during any other feature of the
service. Dignify it by giving it a place and time. Offer a
prayer over it before passing it to the treasury.</p>

<p><b>94. How to Use the Money.</b>&mdash;The larger share of the money
contributed by a Sunday-school ought, if possible, to be devoted
to missionary work and benevolences. A certain proportion
of the money should be passed over to the church treasury, so
that every member of the school may know that he is helping to
support the church, and feel that the church's pastor is his pastor.
A certain portion of the money should be used for the expenses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
of the school. This will teach economy and independence.
The proper division of these funds will not be the same in all
cases, but should be determined by the Financial Board, in view
of the local conditions and needs.</p>

<p><b>95. Records and Reports.</b>&mdash;No account should be kept of
the money given by any member, but only of the fact of giving.
Thus may be avoided the appeal to the pride of the well-to-do,
and the envy of the very poor. The report for each Sunday
should show how many givers and how many omitters there are
in each department or class and in the whole school. Mentioning
the departments or classes having no omitters will stimulate
other departments and classes to seek that distinction. A
blackboard properly ruled so that nothing need be done but put
in the figures, can be made to show this in a manner that will not
be forgotten, and it will be a good object-lesson to the whole
school. Frequent reports should be made to the entire school
as to the use that is made of the money. Printed statements
should be issued, if possible, with full, detailed report of all funds
received and expended, which the scholars may take home to
their parents. The more thoroughly the school and the home
are kept informed as to these financial operations, the more
generous and intelligent will be the giving.</p>

its duties?</p>

<h3>Lesson 9</h3>

<h2>The Sunday-school and Missions</h2>


<p><b>96.</b> "It is the whole business of the church, and it is the
business of the whole church, to carry the whole Gospel to the
whole world as speedily as possible." Missionary work is not
<i>one</i> of the features of church activity; it is <i>the</i> one all-important
work of every church, every Sunday-school, every Christian.
Without intelligent missionary interest there can be little spiritual
power. Every Sunday-school should be, in fact, a missionary
organization, and set itself to definite, far-reaching missionary
tasks.</p>

<p><b>97. Missionary Secretary.</b>&mdash;Every Sunday-school should
have a Missionary Secretary. He should be deeply interested
in missions, and as thoroughly informed as possible. He should
bring to the school from time to time the latest missionary
intelligence, especially from those fields in which the denomination,
the church, and the school are most interested. He will
select the missionary books for the scholars' and the teachers'
library. He should co-operate with the other officers and
teachers in creating and maintaining a missionary atmosphere
in the school.</p>

<p><b>98. Missionary Committee.</b>&mdash;If the school is large, a Missionary
Committee will be useful. It should be under the general
direction of the Missionary Secretary, and should consist of one
person from each department of the school. This will insure
that all departments are brought into vital touch with the
missionary activities of the school. Such a committee will be
most helpful in arranging missionary programs, selecting members
for the mission study classes, planning the entire missionary
instruction of the school, and attending to the proper distribution
of missionary periodicals and literature. This committee
may also assist in securing a missionary training of the teachers
in the teacher-training classes.</p>

<p><b>99. Missionary Libraries.</b>&mdash;Some of the choice, bright,
interesting missionary books which are now very abundant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
should be in every Sunday-school library. If selections are
properly made, the books will be sought for and eagerly read
by the boys and girls. There should also be in the teachers'
library some special missionary books dealing with methods
(see <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>), and the teachers should be urged to read them.</p>

<p><b>100. Missionary Equipment.</b>&mdash;Splendid missionary maps, charts,
pictures, and curios are now abundant and inexpensive. They may be
secured from denominational publishing houses. Every school should
have a supply, and they should be in the care of the Missionary
Secretary. Large charts and maps may be made by the scholars under the
direction of the Missionary Committee. Secure, if possible, a
missionary map of the world, and a map showing the missionary
activities of the denomination. Charts showing the relative strength
and growth of the Christian religion as compared with other religions
in all parts of the world are effective. A cabinet of missionary
curios is most desirable.</p>

<p><b>101. Mission Study Class.</b>&mdash;There should be at least one
mission study class in every school. It is usually possible.
Such classes need not continue all the year. Ten meetings of
one hour each, for ten successive weeks, will enable any class
that applies itself to the work to complete one of the elementary
text-books relating to missions. The meetings should be held
on a week-night, and they should not be obliged to divide the
evening with any other meeting. The available time in the
Sunday-school session is not long enough unless double the
number of lessons are used, and this is not always practicable.
The class should be composed only of those young people who
are deeply interested, or want to become interested, in missions.
Five to ten members are enough for a good class. The leader
should be an enthusiast who is not afraid to work. Such a
class maintained for a few years will create a missionary
interest in any school that will reveal itself in larger offerings,
and probably in volunteers for the missionary field.</p>

<p><b>102. Missionary Room.</b>&mdash;If there is an available room in
the church, it would be well to set it apart as the Missionary
Room. Here will be found the missionary library, periodicals,
maps, charts, and curios, properly displayed and cared for. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
may be a class-room, if no other room is to be had. The Missionary
Secretary will have a table or desk here, and it will serve
as his office. It will furnish a good place for the mission study
class, and will be the center of all the missionary activities of
the school.</p>

<p><b>103. Missionary Sunday.</b>&mdash;Missionary instruction should be
given in connection with every lesson that will permit of it.
Once a month, however, there should be special missionary
exercises, whether the particular lesson lends itself to missionary
treatment or not. Five or ten minutes' time during the opening
or closing exercises can be profitably arranged for by the Missionary
Secretary with appropriate music, missionary selections,
recent items from the field, map drill, and display of charts and
curios. Or, some of the elementary outlines of missionary study
now available may be taught from the platform or taken up in
the classes.</p>

<p><b>104. Missionary Concerts.</b>&mdash;A properly arranged missionary
concert is interesting and instructive. Usually it is best to
confine each concert to a given missionary field. Display a
map of the field. Have participants dressed to represent the
natives. Appropriate music, recitations, facts from the field,
and a short missionary address by the pastor or by a returned
missionary will make an excellent program. Secure from your
denominational publishing house leaflets giving facts about the
field under consideration, and distribute them to the audience.
Once a quarter is none too often for a missionary concert.</p>

<p><b>105. Denominational Boards.</b>&mdash;Every Sunday-school should
contribute regularly and generously to its own denominational
benevolences. Contribute to one benevolence at a time, and
let this one be definitely explained, so that the giving may be
intelligent. Every school ought to be familiar with the great
missionary movements of the world, and especially of its own
denomination.</p>

<p><b>106. Specific Objects.</b>&mdash;More interest can be created and
more money raised for a specific than for a general object, and
done more quickly. Denominational boards, recognizing this,
have provided to meet it by enabling churches, schools, and
individuals to contribute to a specific purpose, under the general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
direction of a given board. Shares to the extent of the donor's
contribution are assigned in a particular station, the donor thus
having a share in the entire work of the station. This is known
as the "Station Plan" of giving.</p>

<p><b>107. Reflex Influence.</b>&mdash;No church, school, nor Christian
can honor the Master by endeavoring to carry out his last
command without receiving a great blessing. The power and
effectiveness of a local school in its own work are usually in
proportion to its interest in the world-wide Kingdom. If it
will "make a little cake" for others first, it will have all it needs
at home. This rule is without exception.</p>

<h3>Lesson 10</h3>

<h2>Organized Adult Classes</h2>


<p><b>108.</b> Organized classes have existed in small numbers here
and there for many years; not until recently, however, has the
attention of the Sunday-school world been especially attracted
to them. When once their value became recognized the idea
spread rapidly, and the organized adult class is now one of the
most prominent features of Sunday-school work almost everywhere.</p>

<p><b>109. Organization.</b>&mdash;Elaborate organization will not be
needed, except in very large classes. It is best to organize
men's classes and women's classes separately. Call together
by announcement and invitation those who are interested in
forming a class, for conference. Furnish them with the leaflets
on organized classes furnished by the denomination or by the
International Sunday School Association. Explain the method
and purpose of class organization. Endeavor to secure a
definite number of charter members to begin with. Adopt the
suggested International constitution, or some other if better
suited to the needs of the class; or appoint a committee to draft
the sort of a constitution desired. Secure the International
Certificate of Recognition, which should be framed and hung
upon the walls of the class-room. It will be well to make the
organization conform to the standard set up by the International
Sunday School Association, and outlined in their leaflets.</p>

<p><b>110. Purpose.</b>&mdash;The real purpose of class organization is
to make the class more effective in those things for which a
Sunday-school class exists. Genuine, faithful Bible study for
the purpose of leading men and women to Christ, developing
Christian character, training for service, securing their membership
in the church, and setting them to work, is the business of
the class. Everything else must contribute to this. With this
as the goal, any wisely conducted class will succeed; but if
anything else overshadows this, true success is impossible.
Thoroughly organized classes will solve the problem of holding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
men and women in the Sunday-school, and are doing it continually.</p>

<p><b>111. Officers and Their Duties.</b>&mdash;Elect a president, vice-president,
secretary, and treasurer, whose duties will be those usually performed
by such officers. The president will preside, not only at all class
meetings, but at the regular Sunday session of the class as well. The
most important officer to choose is the teacher. Select the very best
teacher obtainable, and one, if possible, who is well known and liked
by the class. The teacher and president should be ex-officio members
of all committees. Other officers may be chosen as they are needed.</p>

<p><b>112. Committees.</b>&mdash;Appoint but few committees to start
with, and others as the need arises.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee may consist of the general officers
of the class and the chairmen of the various standing committees.</p>

<p>The Membership Committee will seek to secure new members,
look up the absentees, and visit the sick. As the class grows
in size, part of this work may be assigned to special committees.</p>

<p>The Devotional Committee will have in charge the devotional
services of the class on Sundays and at other meetings.</p>

<p>The Social Committee will welcome and introduce new members
and visitors; it will also seek to cultivate the social side of
the class, providing such gatherings and entertainments as
may be approved.</p>

<p>The growing needs of the class will suggest special committees
from time to time.</p>

<p><b>113. Name.</b>&mdash;There is inspiration in a good name. It may
be the name of some prominent person in the denomination
or community, but it is better not to use the name of any one
still living. Or the name may have the charm of secrecy&mdash;a
word or initials&mdash;with a significance known only to the class.
Whatever name is adopted, make much of it. Let it be prominent
on all the class printing. Many classes adopt "colors,"
and decorate their class-room with them; some choose a class
flower, to be worn on special occasions. Class stationery and
whatever else will tend to cultivate a class spirit is desirable.</p>

<p><b>114. Class Meetings.</b>&mdash;There should be regular meetings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
of the class, at least quarterly. The social committee will usually
arrange for these meetings, but occasionally another committee
should be in charge, as the literary or athletic committee. The
great occasion of the year will be the annual meeting, when a
special effort should be made to secure the presence of all members,
past and present. The election of officers, a banquet, a
fine program, and a glad reunion will be its customary features.</p>

<p><b>115. Relation to the School.</b>&mdash;The organized class should
be a part of the Sunday-school with which it is connected. It
will be better if during the opening or closing service the members
of the class can sit with the school. Their relation to the school
should be the same as that of any other class. Class spirit is
good, but school spirit is better. They should use the regular
Bible lesson. Nearly all classes which have turned aside from
the Bible lessons have gone down. They should contribute to
the regular school fund, and comply with all the requirements
of the school. The influence of large organized classes upon the
boys and girls, thus emphasizing loyalty to the school, is very
great.</p>

<p><b>116. Relation to the Community.</b>&mdash;Organized classes are
now combined in a regular department of the organized or
International Sunday-school work. Each organized class should
co-operate with others in extending and improving organized
class work and methods. Delegates should be sent from the
class to conventions and conferences, and make report to the
class upon their return. The International emblem, a small
red button or pin with a white center, will enable members of
organized classes to recognize each other when they meet.
Much helpful literature for organized classes is now in print,
in the form of periodicals, lesson helps, and books for teachers,
officers, and scholars.</p>

<p><b>117. Benefits.</b>&mdash;A class spirit is fostered. The class becomes a
working force and unit. The organized class has something definite to
do. It sets every member to work. It helps to hold the big boys and
girls in the school. It interests men and women in the study of the
Bible and in the church. It furnishes workers for the church and
Sunday-school, teachers for mission schools, speakers and singers for
evangelistic meetings upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> street and elsewhere. It gives
strength and dignity to the school. It adds largely to the school's
financial resources. Organization carries many a class over the dead
center of discouragement, or the weakening influence of being without
a teacher. A well-organized class will grow, for a time at least,
whether it has a teacher or not.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX</h2>

<h2>Teaching Hints</h2>


<p><b>Two years of time</b> preferably should be allowed for the completion of
these lessons. The International Association will grant a diploma upon
the completion of the First Standard Course, provided at least one
study year has been spent in pursuing the fifty lessons.</p>

<p>If the book is studied by a normal class, meeting at the time
of the regular lesson period on Sunday, only a half-hour will
usually be available; and in this case at least one hundred half-hour
periods, extending over two teaching years, should be used
for the fifty lessons. If full hour periods are available, the
course may be completed within one year of fifty lesson periods.</p>


<h4>The Book</h4>

<p>Although the numbered lessons begin with the story of Adam on page
<a href="#Page_14">14</a>, there are two chapters which may be used as preliminary material, if
the leader chooses. One of these is "How the Bible Came to Us," by
Professor Price, on page <a href="#Page_123">123</a>. There are fifteen numbered paragraphs in
this chapter; if there are at least fifteen members in the class, a
profitable hour could be spent by assigning a paragraph to a member,
several days ahead, with the understanding that each one was to read
the entire chapter, but to be specially prepared in his assigned
paragraph. At the time of the lesson hour pencil and paper could be
supplied to each member of the class. Then beginning with paragraph 1,
all books closed, the assigned member could state from memory the
contents of the paragraph, while all the others silently write down
wrong statements or omissions&mdash;these to be brought out later.</p>

<p><b>The chapter on the Bible</b>, page <a href="#Page_11">11</a>, should also precede the
numbered lessons. The chart given is easily remembered and
each member might reproduce this chart from memory and tell
something of each of the several periods enumerated.</p>

<p><b>The Lessons on the Book.</b>&mdash;It will be seen that each lesson is composed
of several parts: (a) The historical outline, which is placed first;
(b) the geographical work, in a statement of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> places and an outline
map; (c) a paragraph designated "Significance of Events"; (d) the
story of the period briefly retold in simple language. Note the
following suggestions:</p>

<p>(a) <i>The Historical Outline.</i>&mdash;These outlines, taken altogether,
constitute a complete statement of the essentials of Bible history.
They are the framework upon which may be built as elaborate a
Bible story as one may wish. The outlines may well be used
for memory work and in question drills and reviews.</p>

<p>(b) <i>The Geographical Work.</i>&mdash;In most of the chapters the maps
are so simply drawn that they may be used for geography drill,
each student being asked to draw (without tracing) the simple
map connected with the lesson, and locate the places mentioned.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Significance of Events.</i>&mdash;These paragraphs, taken together, form
a concise story of the progress of redemption and revelation, and
state the spiritual teaching of each period. The essentials of these
statements may be memorized, but students should be required to
express the thought in their own language.</p>

<p>(d) <i>The Retold Bible Story.</i>&mdash;Emphasis upon the memorizing
of the other three parts of the lesson should not prove an excuse
for passing by the Bible narrative here given. Without this
the other work may prove dry and uninteresting&mdash;a task. The
student who reads and rereads the narrative with care will find
his memory work in the other portions invested with a vitality
that will otherwise be missing. The narrative section will
furnish abundant material for brief debates, informal discussions,
assigned papers on special topics, and many other helpful
methods. Bible study of historical facts in rigid outline may
be made as dry as dust. Bible study aglow with human interest
and enthusiastically pursued by diversified methods may be
made the most interesting study that can be undertaken.</p>

<p><b>Using the Blackboard.</b>&mdash;The blackboard may be used with
great profit as an aid in reviewing a lesson, either at the close
of a teaching period, at the beginning of a period following a
lesson assigned for home study, or at intervals in the course after
covering several lessons. No special blackboard outlines are
offered in this book; it is urged that each leader shall construct
his own blackboard review from the historical outlines at the
beginning of each lesson on the Bible. Such a blackboard review<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
should be accompanied by questions and answers. Here is an
illustration of the blackboard use of the outlines of <a href="#Page_14">Lesson 1,
The Book, page 14</a>, <i>after the entire lesson has been carefully
studied and with all books closed</i>.</p>

<p><i>Leader.</i>&mdash;What are the great divisions of the Bible?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Old Testament and New Testament.</p>

<p>(Here may follow a drill on the Books of the Old Testament
in their order.)</p>

<p><i>Leader.</i>&mdash;We will begin with the study of <i>The Old Testament
Division</i> (write).</p>

<p><i>Leader.</i>&mdash;How may this be divided?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Into a prelude and five periods.</p>

<p><i>Leader.</i>&mdash;What does the prelude tell about? (Write <i>Prelude</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;<i>Story of creation</i> (write).</p>

<p><i>Leader.</i>&mdash;Where do we read about it?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;<i>Genesis 1, 2</i> (write).</p>

<p><i>Leader.</i>&mdash;Where do all things have their origin?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;In God.</p>

<p><i>Leader.</i>&mdash;What does the first period tell about? (Write <i>First
Period</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;The creation of <i>Adam</i> (write).</p>

<p><i>Leader.</i>&mdash;What "beginnings" do we see in this period?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;<i>The beginning of the human race, sin, and redemption</i>
(write).</p>

<p><i>Leader.</i>&mdash;Where is this told about?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;<i>Genesis 3</i> (write).</p>

<p><i>Leader.</i>&mdash;Who is the leading person of the second period?
(Write <i>Second Period</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;<i>Noah</i> (write).</p>

<p><i>Leader.</i>&mdash;What event is chronicled in connection with Noah?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;<i>The flood</i> (write).</p>

<p><i>Leader.</i>&mdash;What great structure was built in this period?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;<i>The tower of Babel</i> (write).</p>

<p><i>Leader.</i>&mdash;What punishment came to the people for building
this tower?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;<i>Confusion of tongues</i> (write)</p>

<p><i>Leader.</i>&mdash;Where do we read about this period?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;<i>Genesis 6-11</i> (write).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>This method may be followed in the case of each of the Bible
lessons. The blackboard outline for the entire first lesson would
appear about as follows, after being built up step by step:</p>

<p>Each leader will thus be enabled to use the blackboard in his
own way, basing the drill on the outline material at the beginning
of each chapter; this blackboard review will be brought to the
students with a freshness not secured when suggested outlines
are printed with each lesson.</p>

<p><b>Familiarity with maps</b> should be encouraged at every point.
The leader may accustom the class to the question, "Where is
that place?" nearly every time a town or locality is named.
The average beginner in Bible study is afraid of a map; the
more familiar he becomes with these maps, the more confidence
he will have in his own Bible knowledge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The New Testament Section.</b>&mdash;In the several chapters beginning on page
<a href="#Page_71">71</a> the historical outline consists of a harmony of the Gospels. It is
not intended that the student shall memorize this harmony; but the
ability to reproduce from memory the journey map published in
connection with each section of the harmony would give the student a
very helpful grasp on the order of events in the life of Christ. The
use of a journey map as a basis for telling the story of a chosen
period will fix events and geographical location in mind at the same
time.</p>


<h4>The Pupil</h4>

<p>The lessons on The Pupil enter a field of study with which
the average teacher is perhaps less familiar than with the Bible
section. Hence the leader will do well to begin slowly and to
allow plenty of time for discussion in the class. Professional
teachers who have studied the science of psychology may be
very helpful in occasional talks to the class, provided you are
assured in advance that they will not confuse the students by
the use of technical terms. Such talks from outsiders should be
brief, and confined to one phase of the subject, and time should
be allowed for questions by the students and informal discussion.</p>

<p>Students should be encouraged to find their own illustrations for
certain well-defined statements. Take, for instance, the paragraph
<i>Imitation</i> under numbered paragraph 6, on page <a href="#Page_144">144</a>. One or more
students may be asked to bring illustrations of this statement from
their own home or Sunday-school experience in a given week. One will
tell how he saw a neighbor's boy try to keep step with his father
while on a walk. Another will describe the actions of a little girl
she saw dressed in her mother's skirt&mdash;actions plainly imitative of
the mother herself. Illustrations like these observed and reported by
the students themselves will greatly aid in the study of the section,
and will be much more valuable than illustrations ordinarily furnished
in the text. The leader is urged, however, to challenge any
illustration which misses the point or gives a wrong impression.</p>

<p><b>Bringing the Teaching to a Focus.</b>&mdash;In some cases the superintendent of
the department which includes the age under discussion (as, for
instance, The Beginners Department), whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> a member of the class or
not, may be invited to tell in from five to ten minutes how far he or
she is able to meet the <i>opportunities</i>, supply the <i>needs</i>, overcome
the <i>difficulties</i>, and realize the <i>results</i> so clearly stated by
Mrs. Lamoreaux in the closing paragraphs of each chapter. This would
give the whole lesson a local setting and application.</p>


<h4>The Teacher</h4>

<p>The remarks in the first paragraph of the section under The
Pupil, just preceding, apply equally here. Outside help is
desirable, but simplicity in treatment must be maintained.
Profound knowledge of a subject does not insure ability to restate
that knowledge in simple terms. Better not have the profound
knowledge displayed if it is going to leave the students in
confusion.</p>

<p>The principle of home-made illustrations referred to above
applies equally well to the section on The Teacher.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that each adult student in the class will remember
teachers who have excelled in the points enumerated by Dr.
Brumbaugh. The student should be encouraged to take a statement
like that found in paragraph 4, page <a href="#Page_182">182</a>, and say to himself:
"Which of my teachers was notably enthusiastic? How did
this enthusiasm impress me? How did it help him in teaching
great truths?" These observations may frequently need to be
made quietly to the student's self. But they will greatly help
him to master the laws of teaching.</p>


<h4>The School</h4>

<p>Here is a section dealing with a concrete subject, and illustrations
will be within the range of vision of every one who is associated with
Sunday-school work. At the very outset there may be found those who
will take exception to many of the suggestions made, because they are
deemed to be impracticable in "our school." This attitude should be
firmly but patiently overcome. If discussion proves that the thing
suggested is undesirable, or that a better method may prevail, that is
a point worth making. But the argument that a thing is desirable but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
"impossible" should have no footing in a teacher-training class. Let
the motto be, "If it ought to be, it can be."</p>

<p>The teacher may be inclined to skip a paragraph like that on
The Secretary. "Of what interest is that to me?" she may ask.
The answer is simple: No one is equipped to be a teacher who
doesn't know the school as a whole; and no one knows the school
as a whole who doesn't know it in its several essential parts.
Only when the teacher knows the secretary's duties, for instance,
is that teacher prepared to see how careful he should be in meeting
his obligations to the secretary in the line of the latter's official
work. Each teacher should be encouraged to study executive
problems, such as those relating to the superintendent and other
officers, as if they were his own; and at least he should discover
his part as a teacher in helping the executive officers to make
the school a success.</p>

<p>In many localities sections of the class may visit other schools
and report back to the class upon the features in which these
schools excel. This offers a practical laboratory method for the
concrete teaching of these lessons. Of course, such visits should
be made with the knowledge and consent of the superintendent
of the school visited; and at such times and in such manner
that the work of the school will not be disturbed. Teachers
of regular classes will greatly profit by an occasional trip to
another school; it is time gained rather than lost.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Teacher-training superintendents find a marked tendency in
some classes to discontinue the work after the section on The
Bible has been covered. It is a false notion that a knowledge
of the Bible is the only thing necessary for Sunday-school
teachers. Leaders should enthusiastically carry their classes
past this common "dead-point" over into the sections on The
Pupil, The Teacher, and The School; this special effort to
arouse enthusiastic interest in what is to come after the Bible
course will often prevent students from dropping out of the class.</p>

<p>In all the work "make haste slowly." It is more important
to get the work done well than it is to get it done in a given
time.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
